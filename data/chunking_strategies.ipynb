      "----element----\n",
      "1. What are civilizations all about? Think about what makes a civilization a civilization in the (cid:44)rst place. As you read through this chapter, we’ll give you some ideas. Focus on things like the existence and development of cities, formal institutions (including political, economic, and religious), di(cid:35)erent social levels and occupations, the use of technology (we’re not talking the Internet here, but basic and hugely important things such as wheels and weapons), the arts, and methods of communication and transportation. 2. How does change occur within a society? When change occurs, think about what caused it. Sometimes a society changed because it was exposed to a di(cid:35)erent way of doing things when it interacted with another culture (an e(cid:35)ect that is sometimes called cultural di(cid:35)usion). Other times a society changed because its members invented something new, or realized how to use something in a new way. Always pay attention to why things changed in a particular society or civilization. 3. How are people impacted by, and how do they impact, geography and climate? Focus on the interaction between people and nature. We’ll draw your attention to this issue constantly in this chapter. Geography and climate help to explain where people live and build cities, why people suddenly move from one place to another, and how early civilizations chose to defend themselves against attack. They also greatly in(cid:69)uenced which civilizations interacted with, or were isolated from, other civilizations. But people also use technology to impact their surroundings. Civilizations change the landscape by diverting water, moving natural resources, and building transportation networks. Nature impacts people; people impact nature. It’s a great, big complicated cycle … that’s why the AP people love to talk about it so much.\n",

      "III. HISTORY REVIEW THROUGH 600 C.E. Historians, including the AP course, use periods of time to organize history.

This period is marked by some major changes: Figuring out farming and what happens when there actually is enough to eat, developing technologies and ideas to support cities (and to take over other civilizations), the rise of most major world religions, and finally, the collapse of the classical empires.

      "Imagine early people. Really early people. They hadn’t yet built cities. They didn’t know how to farm. Their sole focus in life was to satisfy their most basic needs: shelter and food. Because they didn’t have any advanced tools and hadn’t yet developed anything as sophisticated as farming, the best way for them to get shelter was to find it, and the best way to get food was to follow it. You won’t be asked a lot of questions about nomadic societies. However, you do need to understand why the development of more stable civilizations (which you will be asked a lot of questions about) was so signi(cid:44)cant, and the best way to do that is to learn what came before them. As you review world history before the Neolithic Revolution, focus on only the major developments. During this time period, those include the development of spoken language, the ability to control and use fire, and the ability to make simple tools out of stone. Foraging Societies: Hunt and Gather Foraging societies (hunter-gatherer clans) were composed of small groups of people who traveled from point to point as the climate and availability of plants and animals dictated. Because they depended on nature for sustenance, they were also at the mercy of nature. Climate changes, disease, famine, and natural disasters could endanger or eliminate entire communities. Even when times were good, foraging societies were limited by the capacity of their surroundings, and by their inability to store food long-term. Members of these societies did not build permanent shelters and had only a few personal belongings. Think about how much you can carry in your backpack: That will give you an idea how many possessions they had. Pastoral Societies: Taming the Animals Pastoral societies were characterized by the domestication of animals. These societies were often found in mountainous regions and in areas with insu(cid:72)cient rainfall to support other forms of settlement. Many of these societies used small-scale agriculture to supplement the main food supply of animal products (usually milk or eggs, which were much easier to produce and store than meat). The extended family was a major institution. Women had very few rights; however, these societies were more egalitarian than those that came later. Strati(cid:44)cation and social status, which were limited in foraging societies, were based on the size of one’s herd in pastoral societies. But as in foraging societies, people in pastoral societies had few personal possessions. Even though they had domesticated animals (as opposed to having to hunt for animals), they didn’t settle down in towns because they had to continually search for new grazing areas and water for the herds. As pastoral societies increasingly domesticated more and more animals, they also began to experiment with securing a more dependable food supply through the cultivation of plants. This was a revolutionary development that led to… B. SETTLING DOWN: THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION Agricultural Societies: This Is My Land In a span of several thousand years from approximately 8000 B.C.E. to 3000 B.C.E., groups of people moved from nomadic lifestyles to agricultural lifestyles and town and city life. This transition period is often called the Neolithic (“New Stone”) Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution. Keep in mind that we still aren’t talking about full-blown civilizations. People still lived in relatively small, independent groups or communities. To be sure, the towns and cities that they built were bigger than anything else that came before them, but civilizations on a grand scale didn’t get rolling until around 3000 B.C.E., give or take a few centuries, depending on the region of the world.\n",
      "----element----\n",
      "Here’s how it worked: When people (cid:44)gured out how to cultivate plants, they could stay in the same place, as long as there was good soil and a stable source of water. Because they also knew how to domesticate animals and use simple tools, they could rely on a relatively varied and constant supply of food, and this encouraged them to stay in the same place for longer periods of time. Staying in the same place changed things dramatically, because people in a community stayed within close proximity of each other, which added to their sense of unity and helped them build and sustain cultural traditions. What’s more, unlike nomadic societies, agricultural communities were not just collections of people, but people tied to a particular piece of land. In other words, they began to think of property in terms of ownership.\n",
      "----element----\n",
      "Contrast Them: Nomadic versus Agricultural Societies The di(cid:35)erence between nomadic and agricultural societies is about more than just moving around versus staying put. It also involves emotional and psychological issues. Think about it this way: When you and everybody else is on the move a lot, the land more or less belongs to everybody. But when people stay in the same place for generations, they begin to think of the particular piece of land that they live on as home—their home. If someone else comes along and drinks from their river or builds a house on their hill, they might begin to think of the newcomers as intruders or invaders, not as neighbors. Once nomads started interacting with sedentary societies through trade or conflicts, things started to get complicated.\n"

The Eastern Orthodox Christians of this area spent much time and eort defending themselves from the colonization of various western invaders. It wasn’t until 1242 that Russia succumbed to the Tatars (a group of Mongols from the east) under Genghis Khan. The Tatars ruled a large chunk of Russia for two centuries, leading to a cultural rift that further split eastern and western Europe.

The next chapter will go into more of the details about Russia. By this time, nationalism in Russia was well underway. C. DEVELOPMENTS IN ASIA 1.

We’ll talk more specically about Korea, Vietnam, and Cambodia in a minute.

Under Emperor Xuanzong, the T’ang expanded Chinese territory into parts of Manchuria, Mongolia, Tibet, and Korea. By 907, however, the empire had become so large that local warlords gained more and more power, and the T’ang dynasty collapsed. In 960, after a brief era of restlessness, China was reunied under the Song Dynasty and Emperor Taizu. Despite a long period of peace and prosperity, the Song eventually fell to the Jurchen and then the Mongols until nally in 1279, the Mongols established the Yuan Dynasty in its place.

From the seventh to the thirteenth centuries, the T’ang and then the Song Dynasties in China were accomplished in virtually every category of human endeavor—art, architecture, science, philosophy, porcelain-making, silk-weaving, construction of transportation systems, and more. Yet, it is probably poetry that made the T’ang Dynasty truly unique. Today, T’ang poetry tells us about daily life in China during that time.

      "Chunk -> At the height of both the T’ang and Song Dynasties, China was relatively stable. One of the many reasons for the stability was the bureaucratic system that was based on merit through the use of the civil service examinations (remember which dynasty created it? The Han Dynasty—see previous chapter for review). The T’ang and Song rulers continued to modify the civil service examination, but kept it focused on Confucian principles, which created a large core of educated, talented, and loyal government workers. The T’ang and Song also built an extensive transportation and communication network, including canals. They developed new business practices, including the introduction of paper money and letters of credit (hmmm … where have we seen\n",

All of this, of course, led to increased trade and cultural diffusion. Because the power of the dynasties was based on trade and expansion, each developed an urban base to pursue their economic and political strategies. T’ang power was based on military garrisons along the central Asian trade routes and their capital at Chang’an (today Xi’an), the eastern terminus of the Silk Road and the largest city in the world at this time. This cosmopolitan city hosted a multinational and multireligious population. It was also the center of the T’ang tribute system, through which independent countries including Vietnam, Korea,\n",

Indirect rule of these vassal states spread Chinese inuence far and wide and brought religion, among other things, into China. A similar tribute system would be repeated during the early years of the Ming Dynasty.\n",
      "Chunk -> Focus On: Civil Service in China The bureaucracy contributed to China’s stability in huge ways because it generally stayed in eect even as dynasties changed. Regardless of who was in charge, the leaders generally depended on the bureaucracy to carry out the functions of government. And remember, since appointment to a civil service position was earned by a strong performance on the civil service examination, the civil service was a meritocracy (earned) as opposed to an aristocracy (inherited). So when power changed from ruling family to ruling family, it didn’t impact the earned positions in the civil service.\n",
      "Chunk -> Think about it in terms of the U.S. bureaucracy. No matter who gets elected president, most of the bureaucracy remains the same. Most CIA agents, Department of Agriculture employees, and IRS agents are going to keep their jobs regardless of who is president. Some of the higher-up positions get newly appointed leaders when a U.S. administration changes, but the underlying functions of the government remain remarkably stable.\n",

      "Even when the Mongols ruled in China, the underlying bureaucracy remained. The Mongols brought in foreign government administrators, but the lower-level support and service jobs were kept by locals. Thus the system returned and stayed intact.\n",

Here they concentrated on developing an industrial society, building on many of the ideas of the previous dynasty.

Printed books also spread agricultural and technological knowledge, leading to an increase in productivity and population growth.

The junks were also used as merchant ships, of course. Between 800 and 1100, iron production increased tenfold to about 120,000 tons per year, rivaling the British production of iron centuries later (in the 1700s).

Chinese Women: One Bound to Lead, Most Just Bound One of the more incredible events during the T’ang Dynasty was the rise of Wu Zhao, who became the rst (and to date, only) Empress of China at the death of her husband, Emperor Gaozong.

During the Song Dynasty, adherence to a new Confucianism justied the subordination of women, and foot binding became a widespread practice. A woman’s feet would be bound shortly after birth in an eort to keep them small—if kept bound for a long enough time, they wouldn’t grow even as the rest of the body did.

Religion in China: Diverse Beliefs Following the fall of the Han Dynasty, there were a number of dierent religious inuences in China, such as Nestorians, Manicheans, Zoroastrians, and Islam. But the religion that had the greatest impact by far was Buddhism, especially in two of its forms: Mahayana and Chan.

The Daoists saw Buddhism as a rival religion that was winning over many of its adherents. In the mid-800s under Emperor Wuzong, a wave of persecutions destroyed thousands of monasteries and reduced the influence of Buddhism in China.

Filial piety, the maintenance of proper roles, and loyalty to one’s superiors were again emphasized. 2.

The rst important ruling family was the Yamato clan, who emerged as leaders in the fth century. One of the unique things about Japan is that the Yamato clan was both the first and the only dynasty to rule it. The current emperor is a descendent of this same clan.

In other words, they followed both religions simultaneously. By the early seventh century, Chinese inuence increased yet again. Prince Shotoku borrowed bureaucratic and legal reforms, which were modeled on the successes of the T’ang Dynasty in China. These reforms were enacted after his death as the Taika Reforms (645 C.E.).

Peasants and artisans worked the elds and shops to support the samurai class. Just as in European feudalism, the hierarchy was bound together in a land-for-loyalty exchange.
