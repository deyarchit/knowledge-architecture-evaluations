    "7": "1. What are civilizations all about? Think about what makes a civilization a civilization in the first place. As you read through this chapter, we’ll give you some ideas. Focus on things like the existence and development of cities, formal institutions (including political, economic, and religious), different social levels and occupations, the use of technology (we’re not talking the Internet here, but basic and hugely important things such as wheels and weapons), the arts, and methods of communication and transportation. 2. How does change occur within a society? When change occurs, think about what caused it. Sometimes a society changed because it was exposed to a different way of doing things when it interacted with another culture (an effect that is sometimes called cultural diffusion). Other times a society changed because its members invented something new, or realized how to use something in a new way. Always pay attention to why things changed in a particular society or",
    "8": "civilization. 3. How are people impacted by, and how do they impact, geography and climate? Focus on the interaction between people and nature. We’ll draw your attention to this issue constantly in this chapter. Geography and climate help to explain where people live and build cities, why people suddenly move from one place to another, and how early civilizations chose to defend themselves against attack. They also greatly infuenced which civilizations interacted with, or were isolated from, other civilizations. But people also use technology to impact their surroundings. Civilizations change the landscape by diverting water, moving natural resources, and building transportation networks. Nature impacts people; people impact nature. It’s a great, big complicated cycle … that’s why the AP people love to talk about it so much.",
    "9": "III. HISTORY REVIEW THROUGH 600 C.E. Historians, including the AP course, use periods of time to organize history. Be aware that not everything will fit neatly into a predetermined period, but we’ll try to group events. The first period we will look at is defined by the fact that everything that happened in these 10,000 years sets the stage or provides the foundation for what happens later. This period is marked by some major changes: Figuring out farming and what happens when there actually is enough to eat, developing technologies and ideas to support cities (and to take over other civilizations), the rise of most major world religions, and finally, the collapse of the classical empires. Not bad for one chapter, huh? A. NOMADS: FOLLOW THE FOOD Imagine early people. Really early people. They hadn’t yet built cities. They didn’t know how to farm. Their sole focus in life was to satisfy",
    "10": "Imagine early people. Really early people. They hadn’t yet built cities. They didn’t know how to farm. Their sole focus in life was to satisfy their most basic needs: shelter and food. Because they didn’t have any advanced tools and hadn’t yet developed anything as sophisticated as farming, the best way for them to get shelter was to find it, and the best way to get food was to follow it. You won’t be asked a lot of questions about nomadic societies. However, you do need to understand why the development of more stable civilizations (which you will be asked a lot of questions about) was so significant, and the best way to do that is to learn what came before them. As you review world history before the Neolithic Revolution, focus on only the major developments. During this time period, those include the development of spoken language, the ability to control and use fire, and the ability to make simple tools out of stone. Foraging Societies: Hunt and Gather Foraging societies",
    "11": "(hunter-gatherer clans) were composed of small groups of people who traveled from point to point as the climate and availability of plants and animals dictated. Because they depended on nature for sustenance, they were also at the mercy of nature. Climate changes, disease, famine, and natural disasters could endanger or eliminate entire communities. Even when times were good, foraging societies were limited by the capacity of their surroundings, and by their inability to store food long-term. Members of these societies did not build permanent shelters and had only a few personal belongings. Think about how much you can carry in your backpack: That will give you an idea how many possessions they had. Pastoral Societies: Taming the Animals Pastoral societies were characterized by the domestication of animals. These societies were often found in mountainous regions and in areas with insucient rainfall to support other forms of settlement. Many of these societies used small-scale",
    "12": "agriculture to supplement the main food supply of animal products (usually milk or eggs, which were much easier to produce and store than meat). The extended family was a major institution. Women had very few rights; however, these societies were more egalitarian than those that came later. Stratification and social status, which were limited in foraging societies, were based on the size of one’s herd in pastoral societies. But as in foraging societies, people in pastoral societies had few personal possessions. Even though they had domesticated animals (as opposed to having to hunt for animals), they didn’t settle down in towns because they had to continually search for new grazing areas and water for the herds. As pastoral societies increasingly domesticated more and more animals, they also began to experiment with securing a more dependable food supply through the cultivation of plants. This was a revolutionary development that led to… B. SETTLING DOWN: THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION",
    "13": "Agricultural Societies: This Is My Land In a span of several thousand years from approximately 8000 B.C.E. to 3000 B.C.E., groups of people moved from nomadic lifestyles to agricultural lifestyles and town and city life. This transition period is often called the Neolithic (“New Stone”) Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution. Keep in mind that we still aren’t talking about full-blown civilizations. People still lived in relatively small, independent groups or communities. To be sure, the towns and cities that they built were bigger than anything else that came before them, but civilizations on a grand scale didn’t get rolling until around 3000 B.C.E., give or take a few centuries, depending on the region of the world.",
    "14": "Here’s how it worked: When people figured out how to cultivate plants, they could stay in the same place, as long as there was good soil and a stable source of water. Because they also knew how to domesticate animals and use simple tools, they could rely on a relatively varied and constant supply of food, and this encouraged them to stay in the same place for longer periods of time. Staying in the same place changed things dramatically, because people in a community stayed within close proximity of each other, which added to their sense of unity and helped them build and sustain cultural traditions. What’s more, unlike nomadic societies, agricultural communities were not just collections of people, but people tied to a particular piece of land. In other words, they began to think of property in terms of ownership.",
    "15": "Contrast Them: Nomadic versus Agricultural Societies The difference between nomadic and agricultural societies is about more than just moving around versus staying put. It also involves emotional and psychological issues. Think about it this way: When you and everybody else is on the move a lot, the land more or less belongs to everybody. But when people stay in the same place for generations, they begin to think of the particular piece of land that they live on as home—their home. If someone else comes along and drinks from their river or builds a house on their hill, they might begin to think of the newcomers as intruders or invaders, not as neighbors. Once nomads started interacting with sedentary societies through trade or conflicts, things started to get complicated.",
    "16": "Important Consequence of Agriculture: A Food Surplus Imagine two people who only grow enough food for themselves. They both have to farm all day every day. There’s little time left to do anything else. Now imagine that one person farms enough food for two people. The second person can do something else, say, make tools or dig an irrigation ditch or study to become a philosopher or religious leader. Now imagine that one person can farm enough food for five people, or ten people, or a hundred people. Now the other ninety-nine people can build towns, organize armies, develop a system of writing, create art, experiment, and discover new technologies. In other words, individual labor becomes specialized. Each person can get really good at doing a particular task because he or she no longer has to worry about where the next meal is coming from. As agricultural societies became more complex, organized economies, governmental structures, and religious organizations began to emerge to keep",
    "17": "things as predictable and orderly as possible. Suddenly, there was society, or the beginnings of what we’d call a civilization. With the invention of irrigation techniques, lands that previously couldn’t be farmed could be used for additional surpluses. This would lead to more growth and complexity, which would lead to more agricultural advancements, which would lead to more growth and complexity, and so on.",
    "18": "Focus On: What Contributes to the Development of a Civilization? As described above, specialization of labor is key. If everyone has to farm to have enough food, a great civilization won’t develop. If a certain number of farmers can provide a surplus of food, then other people in the community are free to build, invent, and create tools, art, and institutions.",
    "19": "Impact of Agriculture on the Environment There’s no question that the Agricultural Revolution had an impact on the environment. Farming villages began to dramatically change the lay of the land by diverting water, clearing land for farming, and creating farmland where none previously existed. As villages grew into more permanent towns and cities, roads were built to link them, further altering the landscape. Stones were unearthed and cut to build increasingly large buildings and monuments. All of this activity led to a world in which land and resources were continually being reconfigured to fit the needs of growing, geographically stable populations. What’s more, the impact on the animal kingdom was equally momentous. With the development of large-scale agriculture, animals began to be used not only as a source of food and clothing, but also as a direct source of agricultural labor. For example, oxen were used to pull plows on ever-expanding farmland. This enabled farmers to increase",
    "20": "the size of their fields dramatically because they no longer had to turn the soil by hand. Technology: Metal Workers Deserve Medals If there had been a stock market for new technologies in the Neolithic Era, it would have attracted many investors. During this period, hard stones such as granite were sharpened and formed into farming tools such as hoes and plows. Pottery was made to use for cooking. Weaving was invented to shape baskets and nets; more complex and comfortable clothing was designed. Eventually, wheels were invented for use on carts, and sails for use on boats. The list goes on and on. But perhaps one of the most significant advances of the Neolithic Era was the knowledge of how to use metals. This greatly advanced the development of not only tools, but also weapons. When people figured out how to combine copper with tin to create an even harder metal, bronze, the building of civilizations was well on its way. This development was so significant that some people call the",
    "21": "latter part of the Neolithic Era the Bronze Age. Bronze was superseded by the discovery of iron, but more on that later. C. THE BIG, EARLY CIVILIZATIONS: THE RIVERS DELIVER Most of the world’s early great civilizations were located in river valleys. Think about it. Rivers provided a regular supply of water, which is, of course, necessary for survival. Also important is that the lowlands around rivers tend to be covered with soil that is loaded with nutrients, which are deposited when the river recedes after foods to nourish the soil. The river itself may be home to animals and plants could also provide food for people. Rivers were also a vital means of transportation. When we talk about civilizations, we’re talking about large areas of land with large populations and distinct, organized cultures, as opposed to the smaller farming communities that characterized earlier time periods. Pay attention to the social, political, and economic developments of the civilizations in this section:",
    "22": "These developments are what made them civilizations in the first place. A piece of advice: Do not assume that all civilizations were headed by a central authority. Many early civilizations, in fact, were composed of loosely connected city-states, which were made up of an urban center and the agricultural land around it under its control. These city-states were sometimes combined into one because they shared common cultural characteristics; but they were also independent of each other in many ways and often competed with each other. This is true in modern times as well, of course. When we speak of Western civilization, for example, we mean a whole host of countries that have similar characteristics and cultures but that are distinct from one another and, often, compete with one another. Major early civilizations developed and became dominant starting at around 3000 to 2000 B.C.E. They were located in Mesopotamia, Egypt,",
    "23": "India, and China. 1. Mesopotamia: Lots of Water, Lots of History Mesopotamia literally means “land between the rivers”; the rivers were the Tigris and the Euphrates. A series of ancient civilizations—most notably Sumer, Babylon, and Persia—thrived along their banks. Mesopotamia is part of a larger area of relatively arable land known as the Fertile Crescent, which extends westward from Mesopotamia toward the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the fooding of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers was very unpredictable, so some early settlements were frequently washed away. But soon people learned to build canals and dikes, and began to build their towns farther uphill, enabling large city-states to emerge. By 3000 B.C.E., Ur, Erech, and Kish were the major city-states of the first major civilization of Sumer. Sumer: The First Major Mesopotamian Civilization Sumerian civilization rose in the southern part of Mesopotamia. In addition to successful agriculture and river management, the Sumerians",
    "24": "developed a form of writing known as cuneiform. Scribes used this form of writing to set down laws, treaties, and important social and religious customs; soon the use of cuneiform spread over the trade routes to many other parts of the region. Trade was also enhanced by the introduction of the wheel, a major development that greatly reduced the time it took to transport both goods and people between two points. Sumerians also developed a twelve-month calendar and a math system based on units of sixty (as in sixty seconds and three-hundred-sixty degrees). They used geometry, as well, to survey the land and to develop architectural enhancements such as arches and columns. Sumerians were polytheistic, meaning that they worshipped more than one god. The interesting thing about Sumerian polytheism was that each city-state had its own god that was worshipped only by its people. In addition, there were a bunch of gods that all the city-states worshipped collectively. Sumerians built temples,",
    "25": "called ziggurats, which were kind of like pyramids, to appease their gods. They believed that when disaster struck, it was because the gods were angry. Disaster often struck; no temple could stop the relentless fow of invasions of Sumeria. And by around 1700 B.C.E., the civilization had been",
    "26": "completely overthrown; however, its conquerors adopted many Sumerian traditions and technologies.",
    "27": "From Sumer to Babylon to Nineveh to Babylon As the Sumerian city-states declined, the city of Akkad, which was north of Sumer, rose to dominate the region. The Akkadians major contribution was they developed the first known code of laws, which they wrote in cuneiform, which they learned from the Sumerians. But by 1700 B.C.E., Akkad was overrun by a new powerhouse in Mesopotamia, Babylon. King Hammurabi of Babylon expanded on this idea of a code of laws by developing an extensive code that dealt with every part of daily life. The Code of Hammurabi, as it has come to be called, is often credited as a significant step toward our modern legal codes. It distinguished between major and minor offenses (a big deal at the time) and it established a sense of justice and fairness by applying the laws to nearly everyone (the beginnings of “rule of law”). But Babylon quickly fell due to the invasions of the Kassites and then the Hittites. By 1500 B.C.E., the Hittites dominated the region,",
    "28": "especially because they learned how to use iron in their weapons. Because iron is a lot stronger than bronze, the Hittites quickly became a military superpower. As you’ve no doubt figured out by now, news spread fast even in the ancient civilizations. As soon as one civilization figured out a new way to do something, the information was passed via the trade routes to other groups, who would quickly adopt and adapt the new technology to suit their cultures. In this way, within a hundred years, the Assyrians had learned to use iron, the very technology the Hittites had used to defeat them. This enabled them to establish a capital at Nineveh and, eventually build an empire that swept across the entire Fertile Crescent. Highly disciplined but cruel, the Assyrian army was hated by those it conquered. As a result, there were frequent uprisings against the Assyrian authorities, who, in response, sent large groups of people into exile. This action too played a part in enhancing cultural",
    "29": "diffusion across the entire region and beyond. In spite of their power, within a few hundred years, the Assyrians were defeated by the Medes and the Chaldeans. The Chaldean king, Nebuchadnezzar, rebuilt Babylon as a showplace of architecture and culture. He extended his empire throughout the Fertile Crescent, as the Assyrians had done before him. But like all the civilizations before it, the new Babylon was doomed to fall. A new civilization, the Persian Empire, developed into a major world force.",
    "30": "Focus On: Continuity through Change You probably won’t be asked a lot of specific questions about the long list of civilizations that emerged, one after the other, in Mesopotamia in the centuries between the Sumerian and Persian Empires. However, the Code of Hammurabi and the growing use of iron are both pretty big developments. That said, we’ve given you a quick review because it is essential that you understand, and can demonstrate, that as civilizations were conquered, their cultural heritage, religions, laws, customs, and technologies were rarely lost. Commonly, conquering civilizations adopted and adapted the customs and technologies of those they defeated. The series of civilizations that grew, and then fell, in Mesopotamia demonstrates this point well.",
    "31": "Persian Immersion\n\nThe Persians established a big empire—a really big empire—that, by 500 B.C.E., stretched from beyond the Nile River Valley in Egypt around the eastern Mediterranean through present-day Turkey and parts of Greece, and then eastward through present-day Afghanistan. Huge! Royal Road, which stretched some 1,600 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Aegean Sea.\n\nTo improve transportation and communication across the vast empire, the Persians built a series of long roads.

Within and near the Persian Empire, many smaller societies existed and kept their own identities. Among these were the Lydians,",
    "32": "Within and near the Persian Empire, many smaller societies existed and kept their own identities. Among these were the Lydians, Phoenicians, and Hebrews. The Lydians are important because they came up with the concept of using coined money to conduct trade rather than using the barter system, in which goods are exchanged for other goods. This, of course, led to a monetary system of consistent prices and allowed people to save money for future use. The idea of coined money, like everything else, spread over the trade routes and soon just about everybody was doing it. The Phoenicians are important, first, because they established powerful naval city-states all along the Mediterranean (you’ll read more about this later), and, second, because they developed a simple alphabet that used only 22 letters as opposed to the much more complex cuneiform system. The Greeks later adopted the Phoenician alphabet, and from there it spread and changed, and eventually led to the system of letters you",
    "33": "are reading on this page. The Hebrews are significant because of their religious beliefs called Judaism. The Hebrews were the first Jews. In contrast to previous civilizations in the Fertile Crescent and beyond, the Hebrews were monotheistic, meaning they believed in one god. By around 1000 B.C.E., the Hebrews had established Israel in Palestine on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Although they were frequently invaded by neighboring empires (e.g., Nebuchadnezzar enslaved them), they managed to maintain their identity, in large part because they believed they were God’s chosen people. Under the Persians, the Hebrews were freed from captivity and continued to develop a distinct culture that would later lead to the development of major world religions. Much more about Judaism can be found in Section IV of this chapter. 2. Ancient Egypt: Stay Awhile Along the Nile",
    "34": "The ancient Egyptian civilization developed along the Nile River, where the soil was rich and the agricultural opportunities were plentiful. The Nile cuts through an otherwise arid landscape, so the people clustered along the riverbanks, where, in addition to farms, they constructed towns and cities. Though we often think of ancient Egypt in terms of massive construction projects, such as the pyramids, most Egyptians lived in smaller towns. Unlike the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, the Nile foods at a predictable time of the year and in relatively predictable stages. This made it possible for the ancient Egyptians to follow a very stable agricultural cycle and compile substantial food surpluses. Three Kingdoms in One Civilization You might remember from your studies that, as various dynasties rose to and fell from power, ancient Egypt was reorganized into different kingdoms. You don’t need to remember all the details about the many kingdoms, but you should know that there were three",
    "35": "major ones— Old, Middle, and New—and that it was during the New Kingdom that the ancient Egyptian civilization reached its height. By 1400 B.C.E., it stretched from the upper Nile River valley (at least 800 miles upstream from Memphis) through the eastern Mediterranean regions of Palestine and parts of Asia Minor (present-day Turkey). Egyptian Achievements Even before the Old Kingdom, the entire river valley was united under King Menes, who built his capital at Memphis and led efforts to manage the foodwaters and build drainage and irrigation systems. As a result of the unification, the civilization became wealthy and powerful. Rulers, known as pharaohs, directed the construction of obelisks and the pyramids, enormous tombs for their afterlife. In addition, the Egyptians used a writing system to communicate. Known as hieroglyphics, this system consisted of a series of pictures (hieroglyphs) that represented letters and words. The Egyptians were also very interested in astronomy, which",
    "36": "led to their creation of a fairly reliable calendar. Over time, the civilization became dependent on trade because its people needed a constant supply of timber and stone for their many ambitious building projects, and because their culture valued luxuries such as gold and spices. Besides giving them access to the goods they wanted and needed, trading had an enormous impact on the Egyptians because it brought them into contact with other civilizations. You Can Take It with You Like most Mesopotamian societies, the Egyptians were polytheistic. The most significant aspect of their religious beliefs was the focus on life after death—the afterlife. Many societies shared this belief, but the Egyptians were convinced they could take earthly belongings with them to the afterlife, where they would be happy and well-fed and would continue doing many of the same things they did while in their earthly lives. They also believed that they would be able to use their bodies in the afterlife, and this",
    "37": "led to the invention of mummification, a process",
    "38": "lives. They also believed that they would be able to use their bodies in the afterlife, and this led to the invention of mummification, a process of preserving dead bodies (although this was only available to the elite members of Egyptian society). The pharaohs, as you know, built huge pyramids to house their mummified bodies and earthly treasures. Egyptian Women, Hear Them Roar The first female ruler known in history was Queen Hatshepsut, who ruled for 22 years during the New Kingdom. She is credited with greatly expanding Egyptian trade expeditions. The relatively high status of women extended beyond royalty with most Egyptian women enjoying more rights and opportunities to express individuality than their counterparts in Mesopotamia. During the New Kingdom in particular, women could buy and sell property, inherit property, and choose to will their property how they pleased. Women also had the right to dissolve their marriages. That said, women were still expected to be subservient",
    "39": "to men and were valued most when they bore children. Young girls were also not educated nearly as well as young boys. Egyptian Social Structure: Another Pyramid The tombs of the pharaohs weren’t the only pyramids in Egypt. Egyptian social structure was in the form of a pyramid as well. At the top of the pyramid was the pharaoh, of course, and below him were the priests. Below the priests were nobles, followed by merchants and skilled artisans, which included physicians; at the bottom of the pyramid was the largest group: peasants. The peasants worked the land and generated most of the wealth for the kingdom. Specifically, the pharaoh owned all the land in the kingdom, so the goods produced on the land were considered his property. Typically, the peasants were expected to give over half of what they produced to the kingdom. Also at the bottom level of the pyramid were the slaves, who were mostly either prisoners of war captured during the Egyptian conquest of surrounding regions, or the",
    "40": "descendents of those prisoners. It cannot be denied that most slaves lived a hard life, but in many cases they were not much worse off than many of the peasants. Slaves worked on the land or on irrigation or building projects alongside the peasants, and on occasion were appointed to trusted positions within the government or within the palaces. Ancient Egypt in Decline By 1100 B.C.E. and for the next thousand years, ancient Egypt fell into decline, and both the Assyrian Empire and the Persian Empire conquered parts of this once-great civilization. Later, the Greeks occupied Egypt, and eventually the Romans completely absorbed Egypt into their empire. More on the Greeks and Romans later.",
    "41": "Compare Them: The Decline of Egypt and Mesopotamian Civilizations Be sure to take note of the fact that whenever a civilization became powerful and prosperous, it attracted a lot of attention and envy from its neighbors, who wanted a piece of the action. Typically, this was the breeding ground for invasions. By the time it came under attack, the wealthy civilization was often so big it couldn’t adequately protect all its borders, so over a period of time it began to weaken. This was true of the empires that arose in Mesopotamia and in ancient Egypt. As you continue to read, you’ll learn that it was true of the Greeks and Romans as well.",
    "42": "3. Indus Valley Civilization: Indus Industry Ruled Like Mesopotamia and Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization was built along the banks of a river system. But because of the huge mountains north and west of the Indus River, contact with outside civilizations was more limited there than in Mesopotamia, which was under continual threat by invaders. That is not to say that the Indus Valley was entirely cut off. The Khyber Pass through the Hindu Kush Mountains provided a connection to the outside world and was used by merchants on trade excursions. Later, as you might guess, it also gave invading forces a way into the land. From approximately 2500 to 1500 B.C.E., the ancient Indus Valley civilization stretched for more than 900 miles along the Indus River in what today is northwestern India. Its two major cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, were each home to perhaps more than 100,000 people— enormous cities by ancient standards. There is strong evidence that the cities were master-planned,",
    "43": "uniformly constructed, and had sophisticated wastewater systems. This indicates that the Indus people had a strong central government, probably led by a priest-king. Like the major religions of Egypt and Sumer, those in the Indus Valley were polytheistic. Like the architecture of its cities, Indus Valley industry was top-notch. In addition to using technologies such as potter’s wheels, the Indus Valley farmers grew cotton, and its artisans made cloth. This became an extremely important trade item among merchants traveling through the Khyber Pass to Mesopotamia. Sometime around 1900 B.C.E., the cities of the Indus Valley were abandoned, for reasons that remain unknown today. All that is known is that, by 1500 B.C.E., the civilization crumbled with the arrival of the Aryans. The Arrival of the Aryans The Aryans were nomadic tribes from north of the Caucasus Mountains (near the Black and Caspian Seas). Using horses and advanced weaponry, they easily defeated the populations in the Indus",
    "44": "Valley. Each of the Aryan tribes migrated to India independently; over a period of time, they began to settle in the Indus Valley, where they would give up their nomadic lifestyles. The important thing to remember about the Aryan conquest of the Indus Valley is the establishment of their religious beliefs on the Indian subcontinent, in particular their belief in reincarnation. The Aryans, yet another polytheistic people, recorded their beliefs and traditions in the Vedas and the Upanishads. Over centuries, these early Aryan beliefs evolved to form the basis for what later became Hinduism, which is discussed in detail in Section IV of this chapter. The Aryan social structure also had a major impact on later developments in India. Combined with Hinduism, it formed the basis of what later became the caste system. Initially, the Aryan social structure divided its people into three classes, in this order from top to bottom: warriors, priests, and peasants. Later, a class of landowners and",
    "45": "merchants would be added above the peasant class; and the priest class (known as Brahmans) would be moved above the warrior class because they were considered closer to the gods. In the early days of this system, movement between classes was allowed. But as the system became more complex and ingrained in society, it became more rigid. Eventually, subcastes were added to the four main castes, and social mobility among the castes was prohibited. Because",
    "46": "it became more rigid. Eventually, subcastes were added to the four main castes, and social mobility among the castes was prohibited. Because members of different castes could not marry, children were born into the same castes as their parents, and stayed there. 4. Early China: Shang on the Hwang Shang China rose in the Hwang Ho River Valley (also known as the Yellow River Valley), and like other river-basin communities, used its stable agricultural surplus to build a trade-centered civilization. At its height, Shang controlled large parts of northern China and was militarily quite powerful. Thousands of its workers built walls around the towns and cities along the river; its warriors used chariots to defeat their enemies. The Shang dynasty controlled the Yellow River Valley from around 1600 to around 1100 B.C.E.",
    "47": "However, Shang China had limited contact with the rest of the world, though it did trade with Mesopotamia (a very long journey!). The Shang were so isolated, in fact, that they believed themselves to be at the center of the world, which explains why they called their civilization “All Under Heaven.” This belief contributed to the Shang’s ethnocentric attitude, which means they considered themselves superior to all others. The Shang certainly had reasons to be proud. Not only were they accomplished bronze workers, but they also used horse-drawn chariots, developed the spoked wheel, and became experts in the production of pottery and silk. What’s more, they devised a decimal system and a highly accurate calendar. Focus on the Family The extended family was an important institution in many ancient civilizations across the globe, but nowhere was it more important than in Shang China. There, multiple generations of the same family lived in the same household in a patriarchal structure (led",
    "48": "by the eldest male). Shang religion held that gods controlled all aspects of peoples’ lives; people also believed they could call on the spirits of their dead ancestors to act as their advocates with the gods. This gave the extended family even greater significance. Enter the Zhou Around 1100 B.C.E., the Shang were ousted by Wu Wang, who established the Zhou Dynasty (also spelled Chou Dynasty), which maintained many of the traditions and customs developed under the Shang Dynasty (sound familiar?). The Zhou ruled China for nearly 900 years, longer than any other dynasty. Think of how long the United States has existed as an independent country, then multiply it by four. Now you have an idea how long the Zhou dynasty existed. The Zhou Dynasty believed in what was called the Mandate of Heaven, meaning that heaven would grant the Zhou power only as long as its rulers governed justly and wisely. Put another way, the Zhou Dynasty would remain in power only as long as it had the blessing of",
    "49": "heaven. The Zhou developed a feudal system in China, similar to that of Europe during the Middle Ages (which we’ll talk about more in the next chapter). The king was the ruler of the entire empire, but because it was too big for one person to manage, nobles were given power over smaller regions within the empire. This worked out well for a couple hundred years. The king gave each noble protection as long as the noble remained loyal to him. But as time passed, a number of the nobles built up a lot of wealth and power within the regions under their control and eventually split off into independent kingdoms. Some of the most complex kingdoms developed bureaucracies within their governments, which was a way of organizing government tasks by department, or bureau, so that different parts of the government could specialize and stabilize. A bureaucratic form of government remained popular in China for thousands of years. Eventually, though, fighting and warfare among the feudal kingdoms",

West Africa: Bantu Migrations and the “Stateless Society” Beginning around 1500 B.C.E., farmers in the Niger and Benue River valleys in West Africa began migrating south and east, bringing with them their languages (from the Bantu family of languages) and their knowledge of agriculture and metallurgy. These migrations, usually referred to as the Bantu migrations, continued over the course of the next 2,000 years. Bantu speakers gradually moved into areas formerly occupied by nomads. Some of the nomads simply moved on, and some of them adopted the more sedentary culture of the Bantu. It is generally believed that the migration was spurred by climactic changes, which made the area now known as the Sahara Desert too dry to live in. People moved south out of the Sahara into the Bantu’s homeland, which in turn caused them to move to the forests of Central Africa, then eventually beyond the forests to the east and south. However, not all",
    "51": "Bantu-speakers moved away. Further north in the upper Niger River valley can be found the remains of Jenne-Jeno, believed to be the first city in sub-Saharan Africa. Beginning as a small fishing settlement around 250 B.C.E. and reaching urban size in 400 C.E., Jenne-Jeno is unusual because although it reached urban density, its architecture suggests that it was not a hierarchically organized society. Instead, archeologists believe that it was a unique form of urbanism comprising a collection of individual communities. It just goes to show, once again, that not all human societies have followed the same path toward sophistication, and that urbanization doesn’t necessarily mean centralization.",
    "52": "Focus On: Migrations Why do people migrate? People migrate for the same reason animals do: to find food and a hospitable environment in which to live. Nomadic peoples by definition are migratory, moving from place to place with the seasons to follow food sources. Agricultural peoples also migrated, following the seasons and therefore agricultural cycles. To maintain a stable home, people also migrated to avoid natural disasters or climatic changes that permanently change the environment, making it too hot and dry (the Sahara Desert’s expansion), too cold (Ice Ages), or too wet (flooding cycles of major rivers such as the Yellow River in China). Migration isn’t always solely the result of random environmental change. Overpopulation of a particular area can exhaust the food supply, forcing people to move elsewhere, often displacing a smaller or weaker population in the process. Massive migrations of people from Ireland during the famines of the mid-nineteenth century were caused by a mix",
    "53": "of politics, destructive farming methods, and an unpleasant fungus that wiped out the populace’s main source of food. The Jewish diaspora, the slave trade, and the waves of immigrants coming from Europe to the Americas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are examples of more modern-day migrations caused by people rather than nature.",
    "54": "D. EARLY MESOAMERICA AND ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA: FOR EVERY RULE THERE’S AN EXCEPTION In the Americas, two early civilizations existed: the Olmec, in what we know today as Mexico, from 1200 to 1400 B.C.E., and the Chavin in the Andes from 900 to 300 B.C.E.",
    "55": "The Olmec were an urban society supported by surpluses of corn, beans, and squash. Like most early societies, they mastered irrigation techniques and constructed large-scale buildings; they were polytheistic, and developed a system of writing and a calendar. The Chavin were another urban civilization, and their people were also polytheistic. But, while mostly agricultural, they also had access to the coast, and therefore supplemented their diet with seafood. The Chavin developed ways to use metals in tools and weapons. Interestingly, the Chavin used llamas as their beasts of burden. If much of this sounds familiar to you, it’s because the Olmec and the Chavin developed similarly to other early civilizations discussed previously. So why bring them up separately? Two reasons. First, they demonstrate that the same patterns of development occurred in an entirely different part of the globe, a part that had no contact with the other civilizations discussed in this chapter. This suggests",
    "56": "that developments within civilizations can occur independently—not necessarily as a result of exposure to other civilizations. Second, neither the Olmec nor the Chavin civilization developed in a river valley. True, the Olmec and Chavin had access to water from streams and small rivers, but no major river system served as the generator of agricultural production or as the hub of culture and transportation. Their existence, therefore, disproves the hypothesis that river valleys are essential for the emergence of early civilizations. That’s not to say, however, that rivers aren’t extremely important—after all, the civilizations in the river valleys were among the most powerful and wealthy in all history.",
    "57": "Contrast Them: Olmec and Chavin Civilizations and Other Early Civilizations Although you probably won’t have to remember the details of the Olmec and Chavin civilizations, you should definitely remember this: They are unique in that they didn’t develop in river valleys, as did all the other major early civilizations.",

THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS: MESOAMERICA Although the Maya are often grouped with later Mesoamerican empires, the Aztec and the Inca, they were actually contemporary with Rome, Han, and Gupta and develop some of the same characteristics of these early empires. Mayan Civilization: In Search of More Slaves From about 300 B.C.E. to about 800 C.E., Mayan civilization dominated present-day southern Mexico and parts of Central America. The Mayan civilization was similar to many other civilizations at that time in that it was a collection of city-states; however, all the city-states were ruled by the same king. Interestingly, like the Egyptians, the Maya were pyramid-builders, and also wrote using hieroglyphics. The golden age of the Mayan Civilization was from about 500 to about 850 C.E. During that time, the Maya produced many great works of scholarship and developed a complex calendar system, but we know the most about its architecture and city planning because many remains have been",

The Maya divided their cosmos into three parts: the heavens above, the humans in the middle, and the underworld below. The Maya believed that the gods created humans out of maize (one of the main Mayan dietary staples) and water. They also believed that the gods maintained agricultural cycles in exchange for honors, sacrifices, and bloodletting rituals. Mayan warfare was somewhat unique in that it was imbued with a tremendous amount of religious significance. Days of religious ritual would precede a battle, and the King and nobility would actively participate in combat. One unique characteristic of Mayan warfare was that it was generally conducted not to gain territory, but to acquire slaves, who were used in large-scale building projects and in agricultural production. The Maya had no large animals, so humans were their",

Kings, priests, and hereditary nobility were at the top of the social pyramid. Merchants also enjoyed a high status. The Maya used advanced agricultural techniques, such as the ridged field system, to make the most of the rainfall and swamp conditions of the region. Cotton and maize were widely cultivated; the Maya are known for their elaborate cotton textiles. Many well-preserved ruins of this civilization remain today, including the tiered temple at Chichen Itza, which is similar in design to the Egyptian pyramids and Mesopotamian ziggurats, and several ball courts, which were used for a ritual sport throughout ancient Mesoamerica. Significantly, the Mayan calendar, based on a number system that included zero, was among the most accurate for its time. F. THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS: INDIA AND CHINA Your AP World History Exam will likely focus on four empires in India",
    "61": "and China that existed from around 300 B.C.E. to around 500 C.E. These four empires are the Maurya and Gupta in India, and the Qin and Han in China. Keep in mind that to fully understand these four empires, you will also need to review some of the major belief systems discussed in Section IV of this chapter. 1. The Mauryan Empire in India (321 to approximately 180 B.C.E.) Around 330 B.C.E., Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire and continued into India (more on this in a few pages). During this time, the Aryan culture and belief systems continued to spread throughout India. Then, around 321 B.C.E., a new empire arose in India, one that would come to be the largest in that country to date. Spanning from the Indus River Valley eastward through the Ganges River Valley and southward through the Deccan Plateau, the Mauryan Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, who unified the smaller Aryan kingdoms into a civilization. But it would be his grandson, Ashoka Maurya, who would",
    "62": "take the empire to its greatest heights. A major reason that the Mauryan Empire became so powerful and wealthy was trade.

Interestingly, it was its military strength that eventually caused a dramatic change in the empire. Stricken with disgust and filled with remorse for a very",
    "63": "was its military strength that eventually caused a dramatic change in the empire. Stricken with disgust and filled with remorse for a very violent and bloody victory his forces claimed over the Kalinga in southeast India, Ashoka converted to Buddhism. For the rest of his reign, Ashoka preached nonviolence and moderation. (As you’ll learn in Section IV of this chapter, during the previous century, Buddhism had recently taken root in this otherwise Hindu region.) Ashoka is also known for his Rock and Pillar Edicts, which were carved on—you guessed it—rocks and pillars throughout the empire. These edicts reminded Mauryans to live generous and righteous lives. Following Ashoka’s conversion and commitment to Buddhism, the religion spread beyond India into many parts of Southeast Asia. 2. The Gupta Dynasty in India (320–550 C.E.) After Ashoka’s death in 232 B.C.E., the Mauryan Empire began to decline rapidly, primarily due to economic problems and pressure from attacks in the northeast. But",
    "64": "between 375 and 415 C.E., it experienced a revival under Chandra Gupta. The Gupta Empire was more decentralized and smaller than its predecessor, but it is often referred to as a golden age because it enjoyed relative peace and saw significant advances in the arts and sciences. For example, Gupta mathematicians developed the concepts of pi and of zero. They also devised a decimal system that used the numerals 1 through 9 (which were diffused to the Arabs and became known as Arabic numerals).",
    "65": "By the time of the Gupta Dynasty, Hinduism had again become the dominant religion in India. Hinduism reinforced the caste system, meaning that Indian social structures were very rigid. Though the empire as a whole was enjoying an era of peace, prosperity, and artistic endeavors, women were increasingly losing their rights. Totally under the control of men, Indian women lost the right to own or inherit property, and could not participate in sacred rituals or study religion. And stemming from an increasingly urban society that placed a growing importance on the inheritance of property, child marriage (involving girls as young as six or seven) also became the norm during this era. The Gupta Dynasty collapsed under pressure from the White Huns in 550 C.E. 3. The Qin Dynasty in China (221 to around 209 B.C.E.) Unlike the Zhou Dynasty that preceded it, the Qin Dynasty was extremely short. Though it lasted little longer than a decade, it was significant enough to earn a spot in this AP review",
    "66": "book 2,200 years later. The story of the Qin Dynasty is similar to all the other civilizations we’ve reviewed, in that it developed a strong economy based on agriculture; it organized a powerful army equipped with iron weapons; and it conquered the surrounding territories and unified the region under a single emperor. Same story, new time and place. So how did it earn its spot here? The Qin Dynasty is the empire that connected separate fortification walls that eventually became the Great Wall of China. That fact is more than just an interesting piece of trivia; it tells us that the empire was incredibly well organized, centralized, and territorial. Qin Shihuangdi, the first emperor, recentralized various feudal kingdoms that had split apart at the end of the Zhou Dynasty; standardized all the laws, currencies, weights, measures, and systems of writing; and refused to tolerate any dissent whatsoever. If dissent occurred in a book, he had it burned; if dissent occurred in the mind of a",

What might surprise you, however, is that the dominant belief system of the Qin rulers was Legalism. (You can review Legalism and the other belief systems in Section IV of this chapter.) Although the emperor believed the Qin Dynasty would last forever, it fell only one year after his death, at the hands of the peasants, who resented the Qin Dynasty’s heavy-handedness. The new dynasty that took its place lasted for more than 400 years. 4. The Han Dynasty in China (around 200 B.C.E. to around 200 C.E.) During the Han Dynasty, the Xiongnu, a large nomadic group from northern Asia believed by historians to be Huns, invaded territories extending from China to Eastern Europe. But the Huns were much more successful in Europe than they were in China, largely due to the skills of Wu Ti, often called the Warrior Emperor, who greatly enlarged the Han Empire to central",

    "69": "they carried culture. One of the most significant developments that took place during the Han Dynasty was the civil service system based on the teachings of Confucius. The Han believed that those involved in government should be highly educated and excellent communicators. To ensure strong candidates, the Han developed a civil service examination, a very difficult test lasting for several days. Though, ostensibly, the exam was open to everyone, generally only the wealthy could afford to prepare for it. The consequence was a government bureaucracy that was highly skilled and that contributed to stability in the system of government for centuries. Also during this time, the Chinese invented paper, highly accurate sundials, and calendars. And, like all the other major civilizations, they continued to broaden their use of metals. G. THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS: MEDITERRANEAN From approximately 2000 B.C.E. to around 500 C.E., two Mediterranean civilizations, Greece and Rome, dominated the",
    "70": "region. Countless books have been written on these two empires. There is no doubt that your AP textbook dedicated a considerable chunk to the details of these two powerhouse civilizations. Why all the fuss? Simply put, Western civilization as we know it today essentially began with these two empires. The Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Hebrews, the Persians, and the Phoenicians laid the groundwork, but the Greeks and the Romans left the most pervasive and obvious infuence behind. Perhaps their most important contribution is the concept of representative government, but the Greeks and Romans also made lasting contributions to art, architecture, literature, science, and philosophy. 1. Greece Ancient Greece was located on a peninsula between the waters of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. Because the land in Greece is mostly mountainous, there wasn’t much possibility for agricultural development on the scale of the ancient river valley civilizations. But Greece did have",
    "71": "natural harbors and mild weather, and its coastal position aided trade and cultural diffusion by boat, which is precisely how the Greeks conducted most of their commercial activity. The Greeks could easily sail to Palestine, Egypt, and Carthage, exchanging wine and olive products for grain. Eventually, they replaced the barter system with a money system (remember where this developed? Hint: Lydia, oh Lydia), and soon Athens became a wealthy city at the center of all this commercial activity. Greece’s limited geographical area also contributed to its dominance. Land was tight, so Greece was always looking to establish colonies abroad to ease overcrowding and gain raw materials. This meant that the Greeks had to have a powerful military. It also meant that they had to develop sophisticated methods of communication, transportation, and governance. Social Structure and Citizenship: It Takes a Polis… Like the other early civilizations, Greece wasn’t a country then in the way that it is now.",
    "72": "Instead, it was a collection of city-states, very much like those of early Mesopotamian civilizations in Sumer or Babylon. Each city-state, known as a polis, shared a common culture and identity. Although each polis was part of a broader civilization and shared a common language and many similar traditions, each was independent from, and often in conflict with, the others. The two main city-states were Athens and Sparta. Athens was the political, commercial, and cultural center of Greek civilization. Sparta was an agricultural and highly militaristic region. Most citizens in Sparta lived a very austere, highly disciplined existence (which explains where modern-day terms such as “Spartan existence” come from). All the boys, and even some of the girls, received military training, which stressed equality but not individuality.",
    "73": "Each polis was composed of three groups.\n\ncitizens, composed of adult males, often engaged in business or commerce free people with no political rights noncitizens (slaves, who accounted for nearly one-third of the people in Athens, and who had no rights)",
    "74": "Among the citizens, civic decisions were made openly, after engaging in debates. All citizens were expected to participate. This practice led to Athens being regarded as the first democracy. But it’s important to point out that only adult males could participate, so it was not a democracy in the modern sense of the word. (Interestingly, it was in Sparta, not Athens, where women held a higher status and were granted greater equality than women of other city-states.) It’s also important to point out that democracy in Athens did not develop immediately. As Athens grew more and more powerful, the government changed from a monarchy to an aristocracy, and finally to a democracy. (Note: You may be asked about Draco and Solon. Just know that they were aristocrats who worked to create the democracy in Athens and to ensure fair, equal, and open participation.) Ironically, it was slavery that enabled the Greeks to develop their democracy. It was by slave labor that Greek citizens gained the time",
    "75": "to meet and vote, and to create great works of art and philosophy. Slaves, obtained by various means, were the private property of their owners. They worked as laborers, domestic servants, and cultivators. Educated or skilled slaves became craftsmen and business managers. Some owners helped slaves set up small businesses and then kept part of the profits; and in a few cases, slaves who earned and saved enough money could eventually buy their freedom. Greek Mythology: Many Gods The Greeks were polytheistic. The myths surrounding their gods, like those of Zeus and Aphrodite, are richly detailed and still hold our interest to this day. As you know by now, most early civilizations were polytheistic (the Hebrews being a notable exception), but Greek polytheism was unique in one major respect: The Greek gods were believed to possess human failings—they got angry, got drunk, took sides, and had petty arguments. Greek mythology remains part of Western heritage and language. Every time we refer",
    "76": "to a task as “Herculean” or read our horoscopes, we’re tipping our hats to the ancient Greeks. War with Persia: Greece Holds On Prior to the development of the democracy in Athens, Greece was involved in a series of wars that threatened its existence. The Persian Wars united all the Greek city-states against their mutual enemy, Persia. (Recall that the Persian Empire was the largest empire in the eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia to date.) Much of Athens was destroyed in these wars, but Greece held on and the wars ended in a stalemate. Two huge victories by the Greeks, one at Marathon and the other at Salamis, allowed the Greeks to maintain control of the Aegean Sea. With Persia held back, Greece was free to enter into an era of peace and prosperity, which is often called the Golden Age of Pericles. The Golden Age of Pericles: Athens Wows the World",
    "77": "The Golden Age of Pericles: Athens Wows the World Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens became a cultural powerhouse. Pericles established democracy for all adult males. It was also under Pericles that Athens was rebuilt after its destruction by the Persians (the Parthenon was built during this reconstruction). And it was under Pericles that Athens established the Delian League with the other city-states, an alliance against aggression from its common enemies. Philosophy and the arts flourished, and continued to do so for the next two centuries. In philosophy, we find the names many would regard as the most famous of all the ancient Greeks: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They believed that truth could be discerned through rational thought and deliberate and careful observation, and that virtue and the quest for goodness would lead to internal peace and happiness. Some of their observations proved false in time, especially with regard to the functioning of the universe on a cosmic",

Although our modern understanding of the world differs in many ways from theirs, these three men are still revered today as the fathers of rational thinking. During the Golden Age, Greek drama was dominated by the comedies and tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides; the sculptures of Phidias adorned the streets; and Greek architecture earned its place in history with its distinctive Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns. Math and science thrived under the capable instruction of Archimedes, Hippocrates, Euclid, and Pythagoras (you probably remember the Pythagorean theorem from geometry—guess which famous Greek that came from). Of course, cultural achievement existed in Greece prior to the Golden Age. Homer, for example, wrote the epic poems the Illiad and the Odyssey a few centuries earlier; they are widely regarded as Western civilization’s first",

The accomplishments of this period served as the inspiration for the European Renaissance and the Enlightenment nearly two millennia later—which is why we’re making such a big deal out of them here. Trouble Ahead for Athens Although Athens dominated the Delian League with its powerful navy, other Greek city-states in the Aegean allied themselves with Sparta’s great army to form the Peloponnesian League. Athens and Sparta, as leaders of their respective alliances, became increasingly fearful and envious of each other’s power. After years of increasing tensions, a trade dispute involving the city of Corinth pushed Athens and Sparta into the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C.E. Athens attempted a defensive strategy, hiding behind its great walls while allowing the Spartan army to ravage its farmlands. This worked well for the Athenians",
    "80": "for a time until two tragedies occurred. First, a great plague aicted the city, killing vast numbers of the population including Pericles. Then, Athen’s navy suffered a devastating defeat at Syracuse on the island of Sicily. Athens was never the same again. Although they could have, Sparta didn’t destroy Athens out of respect for the defeated city’s former role in the Persian War. Sparta failed to dominate the region for long; despite its victory, it was so weakened by the war that it became vulnerable to outside aggression. The Macedonians, under the rule of Philip of Macedon, who reigned from 359 to 336 B.C.E., invaded Athens from the north and conquered the entire region. Fortunately, Philip respected Greek culture and, rather than destroy it, encouraged it to flourish. Alexander Adds Greatness",
    "81": "The Macedonians didn’t stop with Greece. Philip’s son, Alexander the Great, who was taught by Aristotle, widely expanded Macedonian dominance. Under Alexander, they conquered the mighty Persian Empire and moved eastward to the shores of the Indus River in what today is India, eventually creating the largest empire of the time. To manage his massive realm, Alexander divided it into three empires: the Antigonid (Greece and Macedon), the Ptolemaic (Egypt), and the Seleucid (Bactria and Anatolia). Along with its size, the Macedonian Empire is notable for the fact that it adopted Greek customs and then spread them to much of the known world. Consequently, much of the world became connected under a uniform law and common trade practices. Therefore, Hellenism—the culture, ideals, and pattern of life of Classical Greece—didn’t perish as a result of the victories over Athens and Sparta; instead, it came to be influential far beyond its original borders.",
    "82": "instead, it came to be influential far beyond its original borders. In the immediate aftermath of the expansion of Hellenism, the economies of Athens and Corinth revived through trade. Of the three Hellenistic empires, the Ptolemaic Empire became the wealthiest. Alexandria, its capital, was built at the mouth of the Nile. Wisely, the Ptolemaic rulers did not interfere in Egyptian society, and, eventually, Ptolemaic Egypt also became a cultural center, home of the Alexandria Museum and Alexandria Library, the latter of which contained the most scrolls of any location in the empire, perhaps the whole world. When Alexander the Great died at age 33, his empire started to crumble. Because the Macedonians were focused on the East and on Egypt, the door was open in the West for a new power to rise to the world stage. That power was the Romans. 2. Rome (509 B.C.E.−476 C.E.) Geographically, Rome was relatively well-situated. The Alps to the north provided protection from an invasion by land",
    "83": "(although, ultimately, not enough). The sea surrounding the Italian peninsula limited the possibility of a naval attack unless a large armada foated across the sea. Yet, although somewhat isolated, Rome was also at a crossroad. It had easy access to northern Africa, Palestine, Greece, and the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), which meant easy access to the rest of the world. Roman Mythology: More Gods Like the Greeks, the Romans were polytheistic. (Every time you see a cupid on a Valentine’s Day card, you see the impact of Roman mythology on our world today.) Many of their gods were of Greek origin, though appropriately renamed to suit their culture and language. Social Structure in Rome: Organized and Patriarchal The social and political structure in the Roman Republic consisted of patricians (land-owning noblemen), plebeians (all other free men), and slaves. Does this sound familiar? It should. It’s very similar to the social structure of ancient Greece. Roman",
    "84": "government was organized as a representative republic. The main governing body was made up of two distinct groups: the Senate, which comprised patrician families, and the Assembly, which was initially made up of patricians, but later was opened to plebeians. Two consuls were annually elected by the Assembly. The consuls had veto power over decisions made by the Assembly. This structure was much more stable than the direct democracies of the Greek polis, in which every male citizen was expected to participate on a regular basis. In a republic, the people have representatives, so they don’t have to vote on every issue. This is similar to the constitutional democracy we have in the United States. Everyone in this country votes for representatives, so it’s correct to call our system a democracy; however, our representatives in Congress vote on all the major issues, so our system of government is also very much a republic. Indeed, the structure of our government was modeled on the system",

Early on, Rome developed civil laws to protect individual rights (in some ways similar to our Bill of Rights). The laws of Rome were codified (remember that the idea of a code was Hammurabi’s, in Babylon) and became known as the Twelve Tables of Rome (the concept of “innocent until proven guilty” originated here). Later, these laws were extended to an international code that Rome applied to its conquered territories. The social structure of the Roman family centered on the pater familias—eldest male in the family—though women did have considerable infuence within their families, with some supervising a family business or family estate. Roman women could own property, as well, but they were, nevertheless, considered inferior to men, just as in Greek society. And, as in Greece, slavery was an important element of the social structure of Rome—at one point, slaves comprised one-third of the",

Roman Military Domination: All Directions, All the Time As Rome expanded, Carthage, a city-state in North Africa with powerful ambitions of its own, became its first enemy. It didn’t take long for this conflict to escalate into full-fledged wars, which came to be called the Punic Wars. These lasted on and off from 264 through 146 B.C.E.",
    "87": "The First Punic War (264–241 B.C.E.) was fought to gain control of the island of Sicily; Rome won this one. The second began in 218 B.C.E. with an attack by Hannibal, a Carthaginian general, considered one of the great military geniuses of all time. In an amazing feat, Hannibal led his army all the way to northern Italy, crossed the Alps (on elephants no less!), and surprised the Romans, who were expecting an attack from the south. Hannibal’s army destroyed many towns and villages to the north of Rome and were on the verge of destroying Rome. But a Roman army had landed in North Africa, forcing Hannibal to return to Carthage to defend his city. Carthage eventually agreed to sue for peace, and this made Rome the undisputed power in the western Mediterranean. Fifty years later, in 149 B.C.E., the Third Punic War was instigated by Rome. Rome invaded Carthage and burned it to the ground. With Carthage out of the picture, Rome continued its expansion throughout the Mediterranean. Part of",
    "88": "that expansion was to obtain Greece by defeating the Macedonians. The Romans also fought the Gauls to the north and the Spaniards to the west. Warfare aided the spread of Roman culture (which, you’ll recall, was linked to Greek culture) throughout much of western Europe and the Mediterranean. To maintain their vast empire, the Romans built an extensive road network and aqueducts, and greatly enlarged their navy. Collapse of the Republic and the Rise of Imperialism Following the Punic Wars, and even as Roman infuence grew, the situation in and around Rome was becoming unsettled. Several events caused this restlessness. First, large landowners had begun using more slaves from the conquered territories. This displaced many small farmers, who moved into the cities, causing overcrowding among the plebeians and not enough jobs to support them. Second, the Roman currency was devalued, causing a high rate of infation. This meant that the plebeians did not have enough money to buy the things",

The result was that the power of the Senate weakened, ultimately to be transferred to three men, who came to be known as the first triumvirate: Pompey, Crassus, and Julius Caesar. Caesar was given power over southern Gaul (France) and other parts of Europe. He chose not to conquer Germany, which would later prove significant. (Germany developed a different culture and would ultimately serve as a training ground for groups intent on conquering Rome.) Civil war between the Senate and Caesar’s followers resulted in pushing Pompey and Crassus out of the picture, after which Caesar became “emperor for life.” But his life didn’t last long.

    "91": "Under Augustus, Rome became the capital of the Western world. Augustus established the rule of law, a common coinage, civil service, and secure travel for merchants. With all these elements in place throughout the empire, stability returned to its people, and for 200 years, they enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (Roman Peace). Interestingly, however, though many of the laws were uniform throughout the empire during this period, a number of traditional customs of the people in the conquered territories survived. This, of course, meant that the distinct groups within the empire, such as the Hebrews or the Egyptians, maintained their individual cultural identities. Under imperial power, the Roman Empire expanded to its largest geographical proportions through additional military conquests. But more important in the history of the Roman empire was the growth of the arts and sciences during this time. For centuries, Greece had been the arts center of the",

When a major empire greatly expands its territory, it becomes the center of artistic and scientific energy. This is because it has a tremendous amount of wealth fowing into its capital from its conquered regions, and because the people have the freedom and confidence to pursue goals other than military protection. This happened in Rome, Athens, Gupta India, Han China, and the other civilizations we’ve discussed so far.",
    "94": "Religious Diversity: New Chiefs of Beliefs Throughout the days of the Roman Republic and during the early days of the Roman Empire, paganism was the state religion. Roman citizens were required to make sacrifices to traditional Roman gods. But shortly after the reign of Augustus, a new religion developed in the Mediterranean and Aegean regions. That religion was Christianity. Christianity grew out of Judaism, which had been practiced by Hebrews in Palestine for thousands of years. Judaism was the first major monotheistic religion. (These two religions are described in detail in Section IV of this chapter.) Initially, both Judaism and Christianity were tolerated by the Romans. The Romans allowed the conquered territories to practice their own faiths as long as doing so didn’t interfere with the functioning of the empire. Eventually, however, Jewish resistance to Roman control led to the suppression of Judaism. And as the apostles of Jesus and missionaries extended the infuence of",
    "95": "Christianity throughout the empire, the Romans began to see the new religion and its leaders as threats to both paganism and their power. To make it clear who was in charge, Emperor Nero began to persecute Christians, even killing them in open spectacles at the Colosseum. These acts of violence failed to stop the spread of Christianity. Only when Emperor Constantine himself issued the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E. did the persecution end. And by 391 C.E., Christianity became the ocial religion of the Roman Empire. Since then, it continues to be one of the world’s most influential religions. H. LATE CLASSICAL PERIOD: EMPIRES COLLAPSE, AND PEOPLE ON THE MOVE During the late Classical Period (200−600 C.E.), all the greatest civilizations that the world had known collapsed. This included the fall of Han China, the Gupta Empire in India, the western part of the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean, and the mysterious decline of the Maya. 1.

    "97": "Nobody’s sure exactly what happened to the Maya. Some say it was disease or drought or the declining health of the large peasant population. Others say it was internal unrest and warfare. Chances are, like other collapses, an expanding population gradually exhausted their environment and could not respond to the needs of their population. But whatever the reasons, the Maya started to desert their cities in the ninth century C.E. and the great civilization fizzled out. 2. Collapse of Han China The Han dynasty was interrupted by the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 C.E.), who established the Xin dynasty after seizing the throne from the ruling Liu family, successfully using the belief in the Mandate of Heaven to undermine them. Wang Mang had been a respected government ocial before he took power, but soon made some disastrous missteps that weakened the empire and his control over it. Attempted reforms of land ownership and the currency were unsuccessful and caused chaos in the local economy",
    "98": "among both the rich and poor. Waging war on the edges of the empire led to conscription of a resentful population and heavy taxation of landowners, which forced them to pay farmers less money for more work. Persistent famines, devastating foods along the Yellow River, and increasing commodity prices added to the resentment and fueled peasant uprisings which Wang Mang’s enemies used to their advantage. The Xin Dynasty came to an end in 23 C.E. with the death of Wang Mang in battle.",
    "99": "The Han Dynasty was restored a couple of years later, but full recovery proved impossible and, in 220 C.E., the government collapsed. For\n\nthe next 400 years, China was divided into several regional kingdoms. 3. Collapse of the Gupta Empire The Gupta Empire fell for one simple reason: It was invaded by the Huns—not Attila’s forces, which invaded Europe, but another group, the White Huns. The Gupta were able to hold off the Huns for the first half of the fifth century, but they did so at a tremendous cost, which weakened the state. By the end of the fifth century, there were Hun kingdoms in western and northern India. Though the underlying culture of India (including Hinduism and the caste system) survived the invasion, the empire did not. 4. Collapse of the Western Portion of the Roman Empire",
    "100": "One historical event that has been endlessly debated over time is the fall of the Roman Empire. Some of these theories are reasonable, others much less so. Many try to assign a single cause to this momentous occurrence, but the situation was much more complicated. In short, however, it can be said that it was internal decay, in combination with external pressure (Attila’s Huns, among others groups), that brought about the fall of the Roman Empire. The sheer size of the empire and the huge expense of maintaining it, coupled by a succession of weak—or just plain bad—leaders, and a series of epidemics, are all factors that caused the empire to collapse. In 284 C.E., Diocletian had become emperor. He attempted to deal with the increasing problems by dividing the empire into two regions run by co-emperors. He also brought the armies back under imperial control, and attempted to deal with the economic problems by strengthening the imperial currency, forcing a budget on the government, and",

Constantine defeated his rivals and came to power in 322 C.E. He ordered the building of Constantinople at the site of the Greek city of Byzantium, and in 340 C.E., this city became the capital of a united empire. Constantine, too, was an able emperor, but the problems of shrinking income and increased external pressures proved insurmountable. After his death, the empire was again divided into two pieces, east and west. The eastern half thrived from its center at Constantinople; the western half, centered in Rome, continued its spiral downward. On its borders, Rome faced external pressure from groups of Germanic invaders (remember we mentioned this earlier?).

Trade routes were fourishing, bringing cultures, religions, and invading tribes into constant contact with each other. Major trade routes over land, like the Silk Road from China to the Roman Empire, took months to traverse. Pastoral communities along the way provided protection, shelter, and supplies for the merchants, in exchange for payment. This meant that merchants not only interacted with people at their destination but also on the journey. Unfortunately, disease traveled the same trade routes (and with invading armies). To give just a couple of examples, the Mongols carried the Black Death to China; Rome and China suffered from measles and smallpox epidemics, which quickly spread through the empires. And, as we mentioned earlier, religion also followed the roads of the merchants. Buddhism spread through East and Southeast Asia by way of trade routes. Christianity",

Through 600 C.E., the religions of all of the Mesopotamian and Mediterranean empires were polytheistic, except for the Hebrews and the Christians. In the east, Aryan religions, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese systems were polytheistic. Some Buddhist sects were polytheistic, as were some Daoist sects. Nuts and Bolts Polytheists believe in multiple gods who impact daily life on earth to varying degrees, sometimes for good, and sometimes not. For example, prior to the rise of Christianity, the ancient Greeks and Romans worshipped numerous gods who had very human qualities and who sometimes battled each other. In ancient Egypt, the gods were often considered benevolent and kind, while in ancient Sumer, the gods were to be feared, and hence had to be appeased on a regular basis. Broader Impact Polytheism had a major impact on the development of civilization: It was",
    "116": "absolutely at the center of art and architecture in most of the civilizations we have discussed so far. Many of the grand works of these civilizations were dedicated to the gods, or made to appease them. More significantly, because the practice of polytheism in most early civilizations was very complicated and filled with rituals, it led to the rise of a priestly class, whose members controlled most of the communication between the people and their gods. Thus, these civilizations became dependent on an elevated group of people who controlled their collective destinies, and rigid social structures with priests near the top quickly developed. Finally, because some polytheistic civilizations had separate gods for each city-state, as well as collective gods for the civilization as a whole, such as the systems practiced in Sumer and ancient Greece, the rise and fall of various city-states was seen as a drama played out not only on earth, but also in the heavens. This added validity to a",

CONFUCIANISM Cultures that Practiced It Confucianism was developed specifically for the Chinese culture, and was widely practiced throughout China from around 400 B.C.E. onward. Nuts and Bolts The son of an aristocratic family from northern China, Confucius spent most of his life trying to gain a high position in government. But he was very strong-willed, and often his thinking was at odds with state policy. As a result, he never achieved his goal. Instead, he served as an educator and political advisor, and in this role he had a tremendous infuence on China. He attracted many followers, some of whom helped share his teachings, and others who collected his thoughts and sayings in the Analects, which would come to have a profound infuence on Chinese thinking, both politically and culturally.",
    "118": "Chinese thinking, both politically and culturally. The most important distinction to make about Confucianism is that it is a political and social philosophy—not a religion. Though fundamentally moral and ethical in character, it is also thoroughly practical, dealing almost solely with the question of how to restore political and social order. Confucianism does not deal with large philosophical issues or with religious issues, such as salvation or an afterlife. Confucianism focuses on five fundamental relationships: ruler and subject, parent and child, husband and wife, older brother and younger brother, and friend and friend. When each person in these relationships lives up to his or her obligations of those relationships, society is orderly and predictable. Confucianism concentrates on the formation of junzi, individuals considered superior because they are educated, conscientious, and able to put aside personal ambition for the good of the state. There are also several values that",
    "119": "Confucianism stresses: Ren—a sense of humanity, kindness, and benevolence Li—a sense of propriety, courtesy, respect, and deference to elders Xiao—filial piety, which means a respect for family obligation, including to the extended family",
    "120": "Confucius believed that individuals who possessed these traits would be not only good administrators but also infuential in the larger society because they would lead by example. He also was convinced that to restore political and social order, morally strong individuals were required to exercise enlightened leadership. This is why Confucius did not support a particular political system, but rather favored good people running whatever system was in place. Under Confucianism, women in China were considered of secondary status, although children were taught to honor their mothers as well as their fathers. Broader Impact Because Confucianism was an ethical, social, and political belief system, as opposed to a religion, it was compatible with other religions. In other words, a person could, for example, practice both Buddhism and Confucianism simultaneously. This flexibility enabled Confucianism to fourish. Government leaders, too, embraced it, because it was intended to create an orderly",
    "121": "society. Its widespread acceptance eventually led to a distinctive Chinese culture in which communities became extremely tight-knit; members had duties and responsibilities to many others in the community from birth to death. Confucianism did not, however, have a similar impact on the rest of the world, because it evolved only within the context of the Chinese culture. C. DAOISM Cultures that Practiced It Some Chinese practiced Daoism, from around 500 B.C.E. onward. Nuts and Bolts The Dao (also spelled Tao) is defined as the way of nature, the way of the cosmos. Founded by Lao-tzu, a legendary Chinese philosopher, this belief system is based on an elusive concept regarding an eternal principle governing all the workings of the world. The Dao is passive and yielding; it accomplishes everything yet does nothing. One image used to demonstrate this is of a pot on the potter’s wheel: The opening in the pot is nothing, yet the pot would not be a pot without it. Daoists sometimes also use the",
    "122": "image of water, soft and yielding, yet capable of wearing away stone. From this comes the idea that humans should tailor their behavior to the passive and yielding nature of the Dao. Thus, ambition and activism only bring chaos to the world. Within Daoism is the doctrine of wuwei, disengagement from worldly affairs, a simple life in harmony with nature. Daoism isn’t completely passive, however. Daoist priests often used magic that was intended to infuence the spirits. Broader Impact Daoists advocated the formation of small, self-sucient communities and served as a counter-balance to Confucian activism. And as an advocate of harmony with nature, Daoism promoted scientific discoveries. Daoists became great astronomers, chemists, and botanists. Daoism’s impact, though, is greater than its philosophy. It’s notable because it coexisted with Confucianism, Buddhism, and Legalism in China. One of the things to remember about Daoism, therefore, is that it added to the complexity of China, which",
    "123": "in turn added to the uniqueness of China and other Eastern civilizations as separate and distinct from the Western world.",
    "124": "Contrast Them: Daoism and Confucianism Though Daoism and Confucianism shared a core belief in the Dao, or “the Way,” they diverged in how each understood how the Dao manifested itself in the world. While Confucianism is concerned with creating an orderly society, Daoism is concerned with helping people live in harmony with nature and find internal peace. Confucianism encourages active relationships and a very active government as a fundamentally good force in the world; Daoism encourages a simple, passive existence, and little government interference with this pursuit. Despite these differences, many Chinese found them compatible, hence practiced both simultaneously. They used Confucianism to guide them in their relationships and Daoism to guide them in their private meditations.\n\nD. LEGALISM Cultures that Practiced It The Chinese, specifically during the Qin Dynasty, are the most notable practitioners of Legalism.",
    "125": "Nuts and Bolts Legalism developed at around the same time as Confucianism and Daoism. It maintained that peace and order were achievable only through a centralized, tightly governed state. Simply put, Legalists didn’t trust human nature and, therefore, advocated the need for tough laws. They believed that people would be made to obey through harsh punishment, strong central government, and unquestioned authority. They focused only on things that were practical or that sustained the society. Not surprisingly, then, Legalists believed that two of the most worthy professions were farming and the military. Broader Impact By adopting Legalism, the Qin Dynasty was able to accomplish the unification of China swiftly, and the completion of massive projects like the building of the Great Wall. But because Legalism also caused widespread resentment among the common people, who suffered under it, Legalism inadvertently led to wider acceptance of Confucianism and Daoism.",
    "126": "Contrast Them: Legalism and Confucianism Although both Legalism and Confucianism are social belief systems, not religions, and both are intended to lead to an orderly society, their approaches are directly opposed. Confucianism relies on the fundamental goodness of human beings, whereas Legalism presupposes that people are fundamentally evil. Therefore, Confucianism casts everything in terms of corresponding responsibilities, whereas Legalism casts everything in terms of strict laws and harsh punishment. The Han successfully blended the best of both philosophies to organize their dynasty.",
    "127": "E. HINDUISM Cultures that Practiced It The various cultures of the Indian subcontinent practiced Hinduism. Nuts and Bolts Hinduism began in India with the Aryan invaders. Review the history of India in Section III of this chapter if you need to. Hindus believe in one supreme force called Brahma, the creator, who is in all things. Hindu gods are manifestations of Brahma—notably Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. The life goal of Hindus is to merge with Brahma. But because that task is considered impossible to accomplish in one lifetime, Hindus also believe that who you are in this life was determined by who you were in a past life; and how you conduct yourself in your assigned role in this life will determine the role (caste) you are born into in a future life. If you behave well and follow the dharma (the rules and obligations of the caste you’re born into), you’ll keep moving up the ladder toward unification with Brahma. If not, you’ll drop down the ladder. This cycle of",
    "128": "life, death, and rebirth continues until you achieve moksha, the highest state of being, one of perfect internal peace and release of the soul. There is no central sacred text in Hinduism, though the Vedas and the Upanishads, sources of prayers, verses, and descriptions of the origins of the universe, guide Hindus. Broader Impact Hinduism is a religion as well as a social system—the caste system. In the caste system, you are born into your caste, and if you are dissatisfied with it, it’s an indication you are not following the dharma; therefore, you will have an even worse lot in the next life. This explains why most faithful Hindus quietly accepted their station in life. Though they knew social mobility within one lifetime was out of the question, they were confident that they would accomplish it at death if they lived according to the tenets of Hinduism. Hinduism’s close identification with the caste system and the Indian social structure and customs have prevented its acceptance in",

    "130": "Hinduism later spawned another religion—Buddhism. F. BUDDHISM Cultures that Practiced It Eastern civilizations, most notably in India, China, and Southeast Asia, practiced Buddhism. Nuts and Bolts Buddhism was founded by a young Hindu prince named Siddhartha Gautama, who was born and lived in Nepal from 563 through 483 B.C.E. He rejected his wealth to search for the meaning of human suffering. After meditating under a sacred bodhi tree, he became the Buddha, or Enlightened One.\n\nThere is no supreme being in Buddhism.

The goal in one’s life is to reach nirvana, which may or may not take several lifetimes, meaning that Buddhists also believe in reincarnation. Buddhism holds that anyone can achieve nirvana; it is not dependent on an underlying social structure, such as the caste system. After the death of Buddha in 483 B.C.E., Buddhism split into two large movements, Theravada (Hinayana) and Mahayana. Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism emphasizes meditation, simplicity, and an interpretation of nirvana as the renunciation of human consciousness and of the self. In Theravada Buddhism, Buddha himself is not considered a god, and other gods and goddesses have very little significance. (Theravada means “the Way of the Elders”; Hinayana means “the Lesser Vehicle.”) Mahayana Buddhism (“The Greater Vehicle”) is a more complicated form of Buddhism, involving greater ritual than Buddha",
    "132": "specified. Mahayana Buddhism appealed to people who believed that the original teachings of Buddha did not offer enough spiritual comfort; therefore, they began to hypothesize that other forms of salvation were possible. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha himself became a godlike deity. Moreover, other deities appear, including bodhisattvas, those who have achieved nirvana but choose to remain on Earth. Mahayana Buddhists also relied more on priests and scriptures. Detractors of this form of Buddhism view these additions as being too similar to the Hinduism that Buddha disapproved of.",
    "133": "You probably won’t have to know the details of the two Buddhist movements, but you should know that they exist. Broader Impact Because it did rejected social hierarchies of castes, Buddhism appealed strongly to members of lower rank. And because Buddhism isn’t attached to an underlying social structure, it can apply to almost anyone, anywhere. As a consequence, it spread rapidly to other cultures throughout Asia. When Ashoka, the Mauryan Emperor who became appalled by one too many bloody battles, was moved to convert to Buddhism, the religion really took off as a major force in Asia. Eventually, however, in India, Buddhism was reabsorbed into Hinduism, which remained the dominant belief system there. In China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, Buddhism continued to thrive. And as it spread via the trade routes, the cultures of Asia intertwined. G. JUDAISM Cultures that Practiced It The Hebrews practiced Judaism.

At the center of Judaism is the awareness of a unique relationship with God. Jews believe that they were created by God and live in a world created by a personal, sovereign God who created the world for humans to live in and enjoy and exercise free will. The destiny of the world is paradise, reached by human beings with divine help.

After all, Confucianism isn’t a religion; Hinduism is polytheistic; and Judaism is monotheistic. But they are similar in that they are all closely tied to the culture in which they are practiced, and therefore are not part of the sweeping, evangelical movements that seek to convert the rest of the world. Each not only arose out of a specific culture, but was used to sustain that culture by providing guidelines and moral authority.",
    "137": "H. CHRISTIANITY Cultures that Practiced It Originally a splinter group of Jews practiced the religion, but it quickly expanded into the non-Jewish community and throughout the Roman Empire. Nuts and Bolts Christianity came into existence with Jesus of Nazareth, a charismatic Jewish teacher who claimed to be the Son of God, the Messiah, for whom Jews had long awaited. Many people were attracted to his teachings of devotion to God and love for human beings. The Roman and Jewish leaders were not among them, and so in 30 C.E., Jesus was crucified. His followers believed that he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, and Christianity was born. Christianity is based on both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that forgiveness of sins, and ultimately everlasting life, is achievable only through belief in the divinity, death, and resurrection of Christ.

Broader Impact In the early days, Christianity was spread by the disciples of Jesus and by Paul of Tarsus. Paul originally was an extreme anti-Christian, who was converted by a vision of Christ and became a principle figure in propagating the new religion. With its emphasis on compassion, grace through faith, and the promise of eternal life regardless of personal circumstances, Christianity appealed widely to the lower classes and women.

Christianity became the dominant force in what was left of the Roman Empire, while the Silk Road and Indian Ocean trade routes brought Buddhism and Hinduism into east and Southeast Asia. V. TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS THROUGH 600 C.E. Farming tools, metallurgy, and the ability to manipulate the environment cause humans to transition from nomadic hunters and gatherers to builders of civilizations and empires in this 10,000 year period. In order to farm successfully, people need tools, a way to transport what they’ve grown, and finally a place to store their surplus. Thus, the most important technologies developed by the early civilizations included farming tools: ploughs, hoes, rakes, the wheel (and therefore the cart), and finally, pottery in which to store surplus for the off-season. While effective tools can be made out of bone and stone,",

Once a society had enough goods, it needed a way to defend itself, and the knowledge that had helped make farming technology was used to create weapons and defense systems. It is not surprising that the first empires developed at the same time as iron technology and wheeled chariots around 1500 B.C.E.! A major development in warfare, the stirrup, developed among the nomadic societies of the Eurasian steppe and spread to Chinese as early as the third century B.C.E. The stirrup arrived late in Europe because the mountainous geography of the Mediterranean world limited the use of chariots and horses there. Additionally, the horses were initially too small to carry heavily armored soldiers. Because of this, the armies of Rome and Greece were mostly made up of foot-soldiers armed with spears and bows and arrows. Ultimately, new",
    "143": "technologies develop because they benefit society in some way. The earliest public works projects focused on irrigation— often simple dikes and canals to capture floods water and precious fertile silt. As cities grew, populations needed steady water supplies and a fairly reliable plumbing and sewage system. The large cities of the Indus River Valley (around 2500 B.C.E), had elaborate public and private sewers, and similar systems were built much later in the Roman Empire. The most visible technological achievements are massive architectural monuments built by all civilizations—pyramids, ziggurats, walls, temples, aqueducts, coliseums, theaters, and stadiums, and roads. These structures were used to assert the authority of leaders, facilitate the functioning of the state, and to keep the populace healthy, employed, and entertained.

VI. CHANGES AND CONTINUITIES IN THE ROLE OF WOMEN An unfortunate fact of sedentary societies is that women lose power as people settle down, and women’s roles in high status food-production became more limited. But women maintained power within the private sphere—by managing their households and taking responsibility for children’s education, wives and mothers were often the unrecognized power behind the throne. Although all of the early civilizations were decidedly patriarchal, women’s freedoms differed depending on social status and class. Upper- class or elite women were",

Public veiling of upper-class women appears as early as the Babylonian Empire and is widespread by Greek and Roman times. Cultural and religious values also impacted the status of women. In both Buddhism and Christianity, women were considered equals in their ability to achieve salvation or nirvana. In both religions, women could choose to remove themselves from traditional roles to become nuns and live separate from society in convents. Hinduism and Confucianism were much more structured and restricted. A Hindu woman could not read the sacred Vedas or participate in the prayers, and could not reach moksha in her lifetime. Daoism in China promoted a balance of male and female, but as Confucianism came to dominate, men were clearly superior to women.

PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER There are many ways to think about the big-picture themes that have emerged in this chapter, but we’ll stay focused on the three presented in Section II of this chapter. 1. CIVILIZATIONS By now, you should have a good understanding of the types of developments common to most civilizations; for example, agriculture, written language, and the use of metals all contributed to the growth of early civilizations. You should also be able to explain how civilizations grow when people are less concerned with where their next meal is coming from, and how they spread their infuence (primarily through trade routes and conquest). And you should be able to describe what happens when civilizations become so dominant that they have no rivals (a period of peace and prosperity, or a golden age, emerges, making it possible to devote time and money to the arts and sciences).

SOURCES OF CHANGE Regarding change occurring in civilizations through cultural diffusion, keep in mind that the two main methods are through trade and conquest. Expansion of major belief systems also plays a major role, but don’t forget belief systems followed the trade routes and the military movements, too. You should be able to discuss some examples of changes brought about by invention and innovation. Two important ones are the use of the wheel and the use of iron. Notice that some civilizations were more innovative while others more adaptive, but most cultures do both simultaneously. Whatever they invent, they spread to others; whatever they borrow, they adapt for their own purposes. That said, certain civilizations adapted an incredible amount from others—the",

HUMANS VERSUS NATURE You should be able to name many ways in which civilizations have changed their surroundings to suit their own purposes. The digging of canals and irrigation ditches, stone-cutting, plowing, and metal-working are just a few examples. And don’t forget the more subtle examples, such as the development of calendars and sundials, which were very significant in the human quest to predict and control nature for its own purposes. To be sure, humans can’t change the repetitive patterns that underlie the yearly calendar, but by understanding those patterns and keeping track of them, humans can predict and use them for their own purposes. Notice that as civilizations developed, they were less subject to natural events causing their demise, but more subject to other civilizations doing so. Notice also that as major belief systems developed, civilizations became less interested in appeasing the gods to protect them",

REVIEW OF HISTORY WITHIN CIVILIZATIONS 600 C.E.–1450 This period is dened by what rises out of the collapse of the Classical civilizations and by the interactions—both positive and negative—that develop between these new states. This period is one of tremendous growth in long-distance trade: the caravans of the various Silk Routes, the multi-ethnic Indian Ocean sailors, the trips across the Sahara to West Africa, and continued trade in the Mediterranean all occur from 600 to 1450 C.E. These 850 years were also dened by a long period of decentralization in Western Europe, and expansion on the trading empires of the Middle East and China. Remember interaction! A. THE RISE OF ISLAM In the seventh century, a new faith took hold in the Middle East. This faith, called Islam, was monotheistic, like Judaism and Christianity. The followers of Islam, called Muslims, believe that Allah (God) transmitted his words to the faithful through Mohammad, whose followers began",

These five pillars include\n\nconfession of faith prayer five times per day charity to the needy fasting during the month-long Ramadan pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during one’s lifetime",

Islam shares a common history with Judaism and Christianity. It accepts Abraham, Moses, and Jesus as prophets (although it does not accept Jesus as the son of God), and holds that Mohammad was the last great prophet. Like Christians, Muslims believe that all people are equal before God and that everyone should be converted to the faith. Early on, Islam split into two groups: Shia and Sunni. The split occurred over a disagreement about who should succeed Mohammad as the leader of the faith. Allah Be Praised: Islam Takes Hold Growing up in the city of Mecca in the Arabian desert (present-day Saudi Arabia), Mohammad was exposed to many dierent beliefs, in part because Mecca lay on the trade routes between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. He was exposed to both Judaism and Christianity as a child, as well as the many",

In other words, the leadership in Mecca wanted to maintain the polytheistic shrines that attracted pilgrimages and brought wealth to the community. Persecuted, and threatened with death, Mohammad and his followers ed to Medina in 622 C.E. in what is known as the hijra (which also marks year 1 on the Muslim calendar). Mohammad and his followers found support in Medina and, in 630, he returned to Mecca and destroyed the pagan shrines—except for the Ka’ba, which became the focal point of Muslim pilgrimage. From there, Islam spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and beyond. The tenets of Islam came to be ocially practiced in Muslim culture, similar to the way the tenets",

The Empire Grows as the Religion Splits When Mohammad died unexpectedly in 632, Abu Bakr, one of his rst followers in Mecca, became caliph, the head of state, military commander, chief judge, and religious leader. You can think of the caliph as a sort of emperor and religious leader wrapped up in one person. He ruled an empire, but he also made pronouncements on religious doctrine. In other words, the Islamic empire was what’s known as a theocracy, a government ruled by immediate divine guidance or by ocials who are regarded as being divinely guided. But because it was ruled by a caliph, the theocratic Islamic Empire was referred to as a caliphate. Islam would eventually branch out beyond the",

As time went on, the caliphs began to behave more like hereditary rulers, like those in a monarchy, except that there was no clear line of succession. The lack of clear succession caused a great deal of trouble down the road. The rst four caliphs were Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. The last of the four, Ali, was assassinated and was succeeded by his son, Hasan. But under pressure from a prominent family in Mecca, Hasan relinquished his title, making way for the establishment of the Umayyad Dynasty. This dynasty would enlarge the Islamic Empire dramatically, but it would also intensify conflict with the Byzantine and Persian Empires for almost a century. During the Umayyad Dynasty, the capital was moved to Damascus, Syria, although Mecca remained the spiritual center. Also during the Umayyad reign, Arabic",

Numerous times during the early eighth century, the Umayyads attacked the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, but failed to overthrow that regime. That didn’t stop them from going elsewhere, and in 732 C.E., the Islamic Empire began to make a move on Europe, by way of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain).

Despite the success of the Umayyad Dynasty (the Dome of the Rock was built on Temple Mount in Jerusalem during this time, and Córdoba was one of the richest and most sophisticated cities in Europe), problems with succession started to emerge. Eventually, the Muslims split into two camps, Shiite and Sunni. Shiite (Shia) Islam holds that Mohammad’s son-in-law, Ali, was the rightful heir to the empire, based on Mohammad’s comments to Ali. Sunnis, in contrast, though they hold Ali in high esteem, do not believe that he and his hereditary line are the chosen successors; rather, they contend that the leaders of the empire should be drawn from a broad base of the people.

It was replaced by the Abbasid Dynasty around 750 in all areas except Spain. The Abbasid Dynasty: Another Golden Age to Remember The Abbasid Dynasty reigned from 750 to 1258, that is, until the Islamic Empire was defeated by the Mongols (more on them later).

Like most of the other ancient civilizations we’ve discussed so far, the Islamic Empire was built around trade. The merchants introduced the unique idea of credit to the empire’s trade mechanisms to free them of the burden—and the danger—of carrying coins. Necessarily, they also developed a system of itemized receipts and bills, innovations that were later used in Europe and elsewhere. In addition to the importance of trade, manufacturing played an important role in the expansion of the Islamic Empire. Steel, for example, was produced for use in swords. Islamic advancements were also seen in the medical and mathematics elds. Mohammad al-Razi, for example, published a massive medical",

This ght for control of Silk Road trading posts in central Asia is relatively unimportant (the Muslims won) except for the fact that the Chinese POWs were carrying paper money. Once the Abbasids gured out how to make paper, they could continue one of their most important activities, building libraries and universities and stocking them with scholarship from all over the known world. The location of the Muslims at the cross-roads of Europe and Asia allowed them to monopolize trade routes. The cosmopolitan cities of the Islamic caliphs thrived on trade, international scholars, and expansion, both military and cultural. So despite the hostility",

For example, when the Muslims encountered the classic writings of ancient Athens and Rome, including those of Plato and Aristotle, they translated them into Arabic. Later, when Muslims and Christians battled for control of the Levant (present-day Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and points north and south) during the European Crusades, Europe found its own history among the other treasures preserved in Arabic libraries and museums. This again demonstrates how the interaction between two peoples (even when violent) can lead to trade and cultural exchange. The Muslims, similar to the Romans,",

The point is, though it was a theocracy, its more exible approach contributed to its rapid growth. The Sufis, Islamic mystics, were its most eective missionaries. They stressed a personal relationship with Allah, in contrast to other religions that emphasize a particular form of ritual. As you might guess, this made Islam highly adaptable to many dierent circumstances. By allowing, and even encouraging, followers to practice their own ways to revere Allah, and by tolerating others who placed Allah in the framework of other beliefs, the Sufis succeeded in converting large numbers of people to Islam.",

If a man divorced a woman, for example, he would keep her dowry (the money and property from her father that she brought with her into the marriage). This widespread—really, institutionalized—low status for women eventually led to a culture in which baby girls were seen as less valuable than baby boys. Tragically this often translated into female infanticide, the killing of an unwanted baby girl. (This gender bias was, by the way, common in many patriarchal societies.) The Qu’ran, the sacred book of Islam, established between 651 and 652, changed much of this. Although women remained subservient to men and under their direction and control, they began to be treated with more dignity, had some legal rights, and were considered equal before Allah. If a man divorced his wife, he would have to return",

Women gained considerable inuence within the home—and in early Islamic society, women sometimes had inuence outside it.

Men were permitted to have as many as four wives, as long as they were able to support them and treated them equally. Women, on the other hand, had to be faithful to one man—in part because in this society land was passed through the males, and the identity of a boy’s father couldn’t be questionable. And, legally, women were treated unequally; a woman’s testimony in court, for example, was given only half the weight of a man’s. Restrictions for women even included what they wore: They had to be veiled in public—although this custom began in Mesopotamia and Persia, Islamic society adopted and adapted it. Over time, Islamic society became more structured and more",

    "184": "Decline of the Islamic Caliphates: Internal Rivalries and Mongol Invasions The Islamic empire regularly endured internal struggles and civil war, often arising from dierences between the Sunni and Shia sects, and from ethnic dierences between diverse groups in the rapidly expanding Muslim world. Numerous rival factions and powers developed, and although none of these threatened Islam, they did destabilize the central authority at Baghdad and cut tax revenues. The nal blows came when Turkish slaves or mamluks revolted and established a new capital at Samarra in central Iraq, while other groups carved out pieces of the empire. There was a new Shia dynasty in northern Iran and constant threats from the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic Sunni group. And like the Romans before them, weakened by internal problems, the Abbasids also had external foes: the Persians, Europeans, and Byzantine.

DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE AND THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE Developments in Europe and points east became quite complicated during the Middle Ages, which is the period after the fall of Rome and before the Renaissance. As you might recall from the last chapter, the Roman Empire, and eventually Christianity, was divided into two factions that split, reconnected, then split again. Ultimately, the eastern Roman Empire, centered in Constantinople, became the highly centralized government known as the Byzantine Empire; whereas, in the west, the empire collapsed entirely, although the religion retained a strong foothold.

Will they ever be able to rekindle the romance? The history of the Roman Empire reads a lot like a bad soap opera. Recall from Chapter 6 that the Roman Empire united the entire Mediterranean for centuries. But it became too unwieldy to govern as a whole, so in 286 C.E., the empire was split into an eastern half and a western half, in what were hoped to be more manageable administrative regions.

Almost 400 years later, in 800, yet another empire was established, the Holy Roman Empire centered in Rome. The Byzantines continued on as before in the east. So again there were two empires, but still one religion.

Compared with what was going on at the height of the Roman Empire, much of Europe at the time was fragmented into small feudal kingdoms with limited power and fewer cultural and intellectual advancements. The Byzantine Empire, like the Islamic Empire to the south, was signicantly dierent. The Byzantine emperors ruled by absolute authority, especially over the economy, whose industries, such as silk production (a trade learned from China), they monopolized.

The Byzantines are also remembered and admired for their mastery of the mosaic art form they used to decorate churches.

Russian churches, for example, conducted services in their own language. In this sense local customs merged with Christian practices in the Orthodox Church. A great deal of the evolution of these religions in these two empires centered on control. For stability, either the heads of the church or the heads of the state needed to be in control.

When Vladimir, a Russian prince from Kiev, abandoned the traditional pagan religion and converted to Christianity, he also considered Islam, Judaism, and Roman Catholicism. Rumor has it that he chose Christian Orthodoxy because it had no restrictions about when or what he could and could not eat.

After the classical Roman Empire fell apart, due in part to invasions from Germanic tribes, these tribes settled throughout western Europe. Most of the tribes converted to Christianity relatively quickly, though politically they continued to run their own shows.

It would be Pepin’s son, Charles (747–814 C.E.), who would revitalize the concept of the empire in western Europe. Like his father, Charles was crowned by the pope in 800 and became known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”). The empire Charlemagne built would come to be called the Holy Roman Empire upon the coronation of Otto the Great in 962. It’s important to point out that this empire had little in common with the original Roman Empire, other than the fact that power was once again centralized and Rome began to think of itself again as a world center. The size of the Holy Roman Empire, in comparison to its namesake, was relatively small. It included northern Italy, Germany, Belgium, and France.

Thus Charlemagne had overall control of the empire, but the local lords held power over the local territories, answering to Charlemagne only on an as-needed basis. And because Charlemagne did not levy taxes, he failed to build a strong and united empire. After his death, and the death of his son Louis, the empire was divided among his three grandsons according to the Treaty of Verdun in 843.

Although the Vikings",

Beginning around 800, they used their highly maneuverable, multi-oared boats to raid well beyond their borders—on the open seas, up and down the North Atlantic coast, and along the inland rivers. The Vikings got a bad reputation for raiding the Roman Catholic monasteries, but don’t blame the Vikings. Island life means limited resources, and raiding was a normal consequence of the pressures on a growing society. The monasteries held much wealth and food, so they were natural targets. But raiding was just one aspect of Norse economy. The Vikings were also merchants and shermen and developed some of the earliest commercial sheries in northern Europe. These activities, along with the raids, led to settlements as diverse as Newfoundland, Canada around 1000 C.E., inland Russia, and northern France. The Vikings even got as far south as Constantinople, raiding it at least three times. In France, the Vikings were known as Normans",

Remarkably, however, in spite of their various victories, the Vikings, too, were converted to Christianity. This continued in a pattern of invading tribes assimilating to a common civilization in western Europe because of religion, not political power. Roman Catholicism became institutionalized at every level of life. By the middle of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church had become the most powerful institution in western Europe and one of the most powerful institutions in the world. European Feudalism: Land Divided Feudalism, the name of the European social, economic, and political system of the Middle Ages, had a strict hierarchy. At the top was a king, who had power over an entire territory called his kingdom. Beneath him were the nobles, who in exchange for military service",

The vassals could also split their lands into smaller pieces and give custody of them to subordinate vassals, who could divide their lands into even smaller pieces in the custody of even more subordinate vassals, and so on. Below the vassals were peasants, who worked the land. For this system to work, everyone had to fulll obligations to others at dierent levels in the hierarchy: to serve in the military, produce food, or serve those who were at a higher level. If, say, you were a lesser-lord, you were obliged to your lord, and you were obliged to your vassals as well.

The peasants worked the land on behalf of the lord, and in exchange the lord gave the peasants protection and a place to live. Many of the manors were remarkably self-sucient. Everything that was needed to live was produced on them. Food was harvested, clothing and shoes were made, and so on. Advances made in the science of agriculture during this time helped the manors to succeed. One such advance, called the three-field system, centered on the rotation of three fields: one for the fall harvest, one for the spring harvest, and one not- seeded fallow harvest (the latter allowing the land to replenish its nutrients). In this way, manors were able to accumulate food surpluses and build on the success. Lords directed what was called the “Great Clearing,” the clearing of huge areas of forest for the creation of more farmland.",

In western Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, the practice of feudalism caused life to be centered on small, self-sustaining communities that didn’t initially generate much of a surplus. But as they subsequently built up storehouses of food and supplies, and as people came into greater contact with each other, they were freed to pursue other endeavors (at the discretion of their overseer, of course).

The etiquette of these disputes and rules of engagement was highly rened and owed from the code of chivalry, an honor system that strongly condemned betrayal and promoted mutual respect. Most of the lords (and knights, who were also considered part of the nobility) followed the code of chivalry.

Peasants (called serfs) in the feudal social system, whether male or female, had few rights. As manorial life evolved, an increasing number of peasants became tied to the land quite literally: They couldn’t leave the manor without permission from their lord. Peasants were not quite slaves, but not free either. Ironically, however, it was this “imprisonment” on the land that led to the serfs becoming highly skilled workers.

Over time, this chipped away at the rigid social stratication of the manor system. When banking began in Europe, towns and cities started to gain momentum. The result was the emergence of a “middle class,” made up of urban craftsmen and merchants. Their success lured more people into towns, in the hopes of making more money or learning new skills. By the eleventh century, western Europe was re-engaging with the world. Height of the Middle Ages: Trading and Crusading",
    "211": "Given the new importance of trade, towns with wealthy merchants arose near the once all-powerful manors. Towns were chartered on lands controlled by feudal lords (the charters gave the townspeople certain rights); and within the towns, the middle-class merchants, or burghers, became politically powerful. Like their manorial predecessors, the towns had a great deal of independence within the empire but were intrinsically more interdependent than the self-sucient manors of the feudal system. Eventually, towns formed alliances, not unlike a city- state structure. One of the most signicant alliances, the Hanseatic League, had an economic basis; it controlled trade throughout much of northern Europe. One eect of the interdependence of the towns was to initiate a drive toward nationhood; another was to increase social mobility and flexibility among the classes. Among the greatest artistic achievements of the Middle Ages was its architecture, specically its cathedrals. In the early Middle",

Gothic cathedrals were designed to draw worshippers closer to God. To achieve this, architects of the day used “ying buttresses,” which gave support for tall windows and vaulted ceilings. Over time, the cathedral became more than a place of worship; it became an art form and an arena for art. The church sponsored artists to adorn the inside of cathedrals with paintings and sculpture. Music, too, such as Gregorian chants, became an intrinsic part of ceremonies. European contact with the Muslim world during the Crusades (military campaigns undertaken by European Christians of the eleventh through the fourteenth centuries to take over the Holy Land and convert Muslims and other non-Christians to Christianity) and over the trade routes helped spur new thought and broadened the perspective of these previously insular people (more on the Crusades in",

In what may seem an irony today, many heretics wanted a return to the simpler ways of early Christianity; they rejected how worldly and wealthy the church had become. Another important eect of people thinking more openly was the founding of universities, where men (not women) could study philosophy, law, and medicine, and learn from the advances made in Muslim cultures.

The various parts of Europe took dierent paths to achieve statehood during the thirteenth century. In Germany, for example, the reigning family died out without a suitable successor to the emperorship, so the region entered a period known as an interregnum (a time between kings).

But during the rule of King John, powerful English nobles rebelled and forced him to sign the Magna Carta (1215 C.E.). This document reinstated the feudal rights of the nobles, but also extended the rule of law to other people in the country, namely the growing burgher class. This laid the foundation for the Parliament. Initially, an assembly was established made up of nobles who were responsible for representing the views of dierent parts of England on law-making and taxation issues.

Rather than compete with the church for authority, Isabella and Ferdinand, both Christians, enlisted the Catholic Church as a strong ally. Spanish statehood thrived under the new monarchy and the alignment with the Catholic Church eectively ended religious toleration in the region. The result was that non-Christians (predominantly Muslim and Jewish people) were forced to convert to Christianity or leave the country. This marked the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition.

The T’ang and Song rulers continued to modify the civil service examination, but kept it focused on Confucian principles, which created a large core of educated, talented, and loyal government workers. The T’ang and Song also built an extensive transportation and communication network, including canals. They developed new business practices, including the introduction of paper money and letters of credit (hmmm … where have we seen these before?).

Printed books also spread agricultural and technological knowledge, leading to an increase in productivity and population growth. By the 1100s, the Song were an urban population with some of the largest cities in the world. Their wealth was based in part on their powerful navy and their participation in international trade throughout southeast Asia. During the Song Dynasty, new technologies were applied to the military.

Song technology also included the production of steel, using water-wheel-driven bellows to produce the needed temperatures. The introduction of Champa rice from Vietnam, a fast-ripening rice, linked with new agricultural techniques, increased food supplies. This led to a rapid population rise from 600 to 1200 C.E. China’s population more than doubled, increasing from 45 million to 115 million. The urban centers expanded greatly.

An able ruler, she was both ruthless toward her adversaries and compassionate toward peasants. The vast majority of",
    "238": "women in China, however, never gained that kind of power. Highly patriarchal, Chinese men considered women inferior, and like European men of the Middle Ages, they considered a woman’s beauty and femininity as virtues worth protecting. During the Song Dynasty, adherence to a new Confucianism justied the subordination of women, and foot binding became a widespread practice. A woman’s feet would be bound shortly after birth in an eort to keep them small—if kept bound for a long enough time, they wouldn’t grow even as the rest of the body did. Large feet were considered masculine and ugly. This practice, which lasted for centuries among elite families, was not only painful, but also often deforming and sometimes crippling. Religion in China: Diverse Beliefs Following the fall of the Han Dynasty, there were a number of dierent religious inuences in China, such as Nestorians, Manicheans, Zoroastrians, and Islam. But the religion that had the greatest impact by far was Buddhism, especially",
    "239": "in two of its forms: Mahayana and Chan. Mahayana Buddhism appealed to many because of its emphasis on a peaceful and quiet existence, a life apart from worldly values. With its emphasis on meditation and appreciation of beauty, Chan (or Zen) Buddhism, won converts in the educated classes, who generally followed the tenets of Confucianism. Both the Confucians and the Daoists reacted strongly to the spread of Buddhism. Many Confucians saw Buddhism as a drain on both the treasury and the labor pool, especially because Buddhism dismissed the pursuit of material accumulation. The Daoists saw Buddhism as a rival religion that was winning over many of its adherents. In the mid-800s under Emperor Wuzong, a wave of persecutions destroyed thousands of monasteries and reduced the influence of Buddhism in China. Neo-Confucianism in China As China turned away from other worldly ideas of the Buddhists during the late T’ang and early Song, new ideas about Confucian philosophy developed. Where older",
    "240": "Confucianism had focused on practical politics and morality, the neo-Confucianists borrowed Buddhist ideas about the soul and the individual. This new tradition became the guiding doctrine of the Song Dynasty and the basis for civil service. At its core was a systematic approach to both the heavens and the role of individual. Filial piety, the maintenance of proper roles, and loyalty to one’s superiors were again emphasized. 2. Japan Because Japan consists of four main islands o the coast of mainland Asia, it was relatively isolated for thousands of years. Ideas, religions, and material goods traveled between Japan and the rest of Asia, especially China, but the rate of exchange was relatively limited. Only in",
    "241": "and material goods traveled between Japan and the rest of Asia, especially China, but the rate of exchange was relatively limited. Only in recent centuries has Japan allowed Western influences. Little is known of early cultures in Japan prior to 400 C.E., except that they were inuenced by Korea and China. The rst important ruling family was the Yamato clan, who emerged as leaders in the fth century. One of the unique things about Japan is that the Yamato clan was both the first and the only dynasty to rule it. The current emperor is a descendent of this same clan. Early on, the Shinto religion took hold in Japan. Under Shinto, which means “the way of the gods,” the Japanese worshipped the kami, which refers to nature and all of the forces of nature, both the seen and unseen. The goal under Shinto is to become part of the kami by following certain rituals and customs. The religion also encourages obedience and proper behavior. The Yamato clan claimed that the emperor was a direct",
    "242": "descendant of the sun goddess, one of the main forces in the Shinto religion. This claim helped the Yamato stay in power—if you believe that the emperor is divine, you’re probably going to want to keep him around. Can’t Get Enough of China? Go to Japan. In the sixth century, the inuence of China in Japan increased dramatically. In 522, Buddhist missionaries went to Japan and brought with them Chinese culture. In no time, Chinese things were all the rage. Buddhism spread quickly, but interestingly, it didn’t replace Shinto. Instead, most Japanese adopted Buddhism while also hanging on to their Shinto beliefs. In other words, they followed both religions simultaneously. By the early seventh century, Chinese inuence increased yet again. Prince Shotoku borrowed bureaucratic and legal reforms, which were modeled on the successes of the T’ang Dynasty in China. These reforms were enacted after his death as the Taika Reforms (645 C.E.). In the eighth century, when the Japanese built their new",
    "243": "capital, they modeled it on the T’ang capital. At the risk of giving the impression that Japan became a “Little China,” you should keep in mind one thing: the Japanese largely rejected Confucianism, as well as the idea of the civil service examination. Why? Both of these systems held the educated in high esteem. In Japan, education wasn’t nearly as important as birth. The noble classes were hereditary, not earned.",
    "244": "Contrast Them: China and Japan Even though China inuenced Japan enormously, it didn’t penetrate Japanese identity. Birth was more important than outside inuence or education. The aristocracy remained strong. Despite the widespread inuence of Confucianism and Chan (now Zen) Buddhism, Japanese continued to observe the rites of their indigenous religion, Shinto. Even at the height of T’ang inuence, it can be said that Japan drew inspiration from China, but maintained its own distinctive traditions.",
    "245": "Here Come the Fujiwara: At Home in Heian In 794, the capital was moved to Heian, and a new era of Japanese consciousness began. The Chinese inuence abated, while the power of aristocratic families increased. One of the most powerful families, the Fujiwara, intermarried over several generations with the emperor’s family and soon ran the aairs of the country. The emperor remained as a gurehead, but the real power had shifted to members of the Fujiwara family. Under the Fujiwara, Japanese society experienced somewhat of a golden age, especially in terms of literature. Japanese noblewomen were particularly prolic, especially when compared to women of other cultures. But by the twelfth century, power in Japan spread among a larger and larger pool of noble families, and soon they were ghting with each other for control over their small territories. In other words, Japan had devolved into a feudal system not unlike the one in Europe. Feudal Japan The interesting thing about feudalism in Japan",
    "246": "is that it developed at around the same time as feudalism in western Europe, but it developed independently. In 1192, Yoritomo Minamoto was given the title of chief general, or shogun, by the emperor. As with the Fujiwara family, the emperor was the figurehead but he didn’t hold the real power. The real power was in the hands of the shogun. Below the shogun in the pecking order were the daimyo, owners of large tracts of land, or the counterparts of the lords of medieval Europe. The daimyo were powerful samurai, which were like knights. They were part warrior, part nobility. They, in turn, divided up their lands to lesser samurai (vassals), who in turn split their land up again. Peasants and artisans worked the elds and shops to support the samurai class. Just as in European feudalism, the hierarchy was bound together in a land-for-loyalty exchange. The samurai followed a strict code of conduct known as the Code of Bushido, which was very similar to the code of chivalry in Europe. The",
    "247": "code stressed loyalty, courage, and honor; so much so that if a samurai failed to meet his obligations under the code, he was expected to commit suicide. Interestingly, unlike under European feudalism, women in Japan were not held in high esteem. Remember that in Europe, noblewomen were given few rights, but they were adored, at least to the extent that they were beautiful and possessed feminine traits. In contrast, Japanese women lost any freedom they had during the Fujiwara period and were forced to live harsher, more demeaning lives.",
    "248": "Compare and Contrast Them: European and Japanese Feudalism They were similar in terms of political structure, social structure, and honor code. They were dierent in terms of treatment of women and legal arrangement. In Europe, the feudal contract was just that, a contract. It was an arrangement of obligations enforced in law. In Japan, on the other hand, the feudal arrangement was based solely on group identity and loyalty. In both cases, the feudal arrangement was based on culture, and so the feudal system stayed around for a very long time.\n\n3. Vietnam and Korea Because China’s dynastic leaders were intent on expanding by means of trade and force, Chinese armies had been in Korea and Vietnam as early as the Han Dynasty. But it was the large-scale military campaigns of the T’ang that resulted in cultural exchange in both regions.",
    "249": "early as the Han Dynasty. But it was the large-scale military campaigns of the T’ang that resulted in cultural exchange in both regions. Korea had its own independent and powerful dynasty, but in order to maintain the appearance of cordial relations with their powerful Chinese neighbors, the Koreans became a vassal-state of the T’ang. The gift-giving and exchanges resulted in Korean schools and the imperial court being organized like those of the Chinese, although the power of the royal houses and nobility in Korea prevented the development of a true bureaucracy based on merit. The tribute relationship was also responsible for the spread of both Confucianism and Chan Buddhism to Korea. The Viet people of Southeast Asia were much less willing to accept even the appearance of a tribute relationship with their northern neighbors, and actively resisted the T’ang armies. Although a tribute relationship was eventually established, Confucian education was accepted, and an active trade",
    "250": "relationship existed between the two entities, the Vietnamese maintained local traditions and continued to actively revolt against T’ang authorities. After the fall of the T’ang, the Vietnamese would maintain their independence in the face of later Chinese expansion. 4. India As you should remember from the last chapter, India was the birthplace of two major religions: Hinduism and Buddhism. In the tenth century, another major religion made its way to the Indus valley: Islam. The Sultan Ate at the Deli? Yes, the Delhi Sultanate After defeating the disorganized Hindus, the Islamic invaders set up shop in Delhi under their leader, the sultan. Hence, this kingdom is referred to as the Delhi Sultanate. For over two hundred years beginning in about 1206, Islam spread throughout much of northern India. While many Hindus held on to their religious beliefs, the sultans were highly oended by Hinduism’s polytheistic ways and did their best to convert them. Like non-Muslims under the Umayyads in",
    "251": "Arabia, non-Muslims under the sultans in India had to pay a tax. But more than that, the sultans were capable of religiously motivated destruction. Hindu temples were sometimes destroyed, and occasionally violence erupted in communities.",
    "252": "Contrast Them: Hinduism and Islam Islam on top of Hinduism was a strange concoction. Hinduism is polytheistic while Islam is monotheistic. Islam holds that all people are equal under God, while Hinduism upholds the caste system. To Islamic people, cows are food; to Hindus, cows are sacred. Hinduism sees itself as universal and exclusive; Islam sees itself as tolerant of other beliefs and even mixed with other beliefs. These two religions have always been a strange mix and have often clashed. If you don’t remember how bad things got between the two groups in India, you’ll review the consequences later in this book.",
    "253": "Despite the dierences between the Islamic and Hindu cultures, an amazing amount of progress occurred in India under the sultans. Colleges were founded. Irrigation systems were vastly improved. Mosques were built, often with the help of Hindu architects and artists. And many Hindus in northern India converted. Sometimes the conversions were genuine, at other times they just made life easier. In any case, a considerable number of Hindus in northern India converted to Islam while the vast majority of Hindus in southern India held on to their traditions. D. THE RISE AND FALL OF THE MONGOLS The Mongols, the epitome of a nomadic culture, existed as a society for a long time before they became a force on the broader world scene. The Mongols were superb horsemen and archers and probably could have been a world power early on in the development of major civilizations. However, rivalries between tribes and clans kept them from unifying, so for centuries they fought with each other and remained",
    "254": "fairly isolated from the rest of the world. In the early 1200s, all that changed. Using his tremendous military and organizational skills, Genghis Khan (also spelled Chingiss Khan) unified the Mongol tribes and set them on a path of expansion that would lead to the largest empire the world had ever seen. Genghis Khan unied several nomadic tribes of Mongolia and led the Mongol invasion of China in 1234, which was the beginning of the enormous Mongolian conquests. The Mongol Empire eventually spanned from the Pacic Ocean to eastern Europe. The empire was split into hordes, or small, independent empires. The Golden Horde conquered the region of modern-day Russia. In China, Kublai Khan ruled. Mongols destroyed cities and were ruthless warriors, but once their domain was established, the empire was relatively peaceful, sometimes called the Pax Mongolica. The continuous empire allowed for the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture from one distant region to another. Mongols, who were",
    "255": "illiterate, nomadic people prior to their conquests and education reforms brought about by Genghis Khan, eventually became assimilated into the cultures of the people they defeated. Warning! You Are Now Entering a Golden-Age-Free Zone One of the most striking things about the Mongols is that their empire was one of territory, infrastructure, and conquest, but not one of “culture.” Because the Mongol Empire was so enormous and conquered so many dierent kinds of civilizations, it did not attempt to force a unied religion or way of life on its people. That being said, although the Mongols did not make many advances in the arts and sciences themselves, their superior infrastructure allowed for the exchange and spread of ideas. Genghis Khan also established the rst pony express and postal system and gave tax breaks to teachers and clerics within his empire. In other ways, however, the Mongol Empire had a profoundly negative impact on conquered cultures, stiing cultural growth rather than",
    "256": "contributing to it by having been so brutal in their initial raids.",
    "257": "Contrast Them: The Mongol Empire and All Other Major Civilizations We’ve seen the golden age of Gupta. The golden age of Shang. The golden ages of Greece, Rome, and Islam. The Mongol Empire was larger than any of the empires that produced those golden ages. Yet rather than imposing their own cultural developments on the areas it conquered, it generally accepted or ignored those of the people they conquered. Unlike the Islamic takeover of India, the Mongols allowed their subjects to practice their own religions. It should be pointed out that because the Mongol empire was so expansive, it tied much of the world together and served as a conduit across which ideas and culture spread from the Pacic to the Mediterranean and vice versa. It’s just that it wasn’t the Mongol’s own culture.",
    "258": "Timur Wasn’t Timid In addition to invading Russia, Persia, Central Asia, and China, the Mongols also found time on their itinerary for a layover in India. They swept in under their leader, the untamed Timur Lang, who destroyed just about everything in sight and massacred thousands, and then just as quickly swept out. The sultanate was destroyed, but after Timur Lang (sometimes referred to as Tamerlane) returned to his capital in Samarkand, the Mongols pulled out as well. Just a few years later, the sultanate was restored. Islam continued to grow in India for the next few centuries under the Mogul Empire, even as many Hindus hung on to their beliefs. Look for more on this later. How the Mongols Did It: No Rest Until Conquest Imagine that you live in a village that lies in the path of an advancing Mongol horde. You’ve heard the stories. If you put up a ght, they’ll pummel you. If you retreat to your house, they’ll burn it. If you organize a resistance in your place of worship or civic",
    "259": "building, they’ll level it. You’ve also heard that if you just give in, they might spare your city, but they also might not. They’re not really interested in changing your culture. So your only real choice, if you want to stay alive, is to give in. If you do, you may or may not be able to keep your life and your culture, but if you don’t, you’ll suffer a certainly grotesque death. What would you do? In the 1200s and 1300s, a lot of people gave in. And those that didn’t met their death. The Mongols weren’t called ruthless warriors for nothing. They knew how to ght. But they were more than erce ghters. They were also highly organized and highly mobile. Unlike the much-feared Roman army, which in its heyday could cover about 25 miles per day, the Mongol horsemen could cover about 90. Their bows, designed to be launched from horseback, had a range of up to 300 yards, way more than anybody else’s. Their armies were divided into units, which were further separated into light and heavy",
    "260": "cavalries and scouting units. They were extremely motivated—Genghis Khan punished traitors swiftly and rewarded the courageous generously. They were stealthy—they had an extensive network of spies that scouted their enemies before battle. Finally, their goals were made unmistakably clear—the consequences of putting up a ght against the Mongols meant certain destruction of the entire village, so most learned not to resist.",
    "261": "In short, they were really, really good at what they did: conquering. The Mongol Impact As mentioned earlier, the Mongols were great diusers of culture. Some Mongols were assimilated by those they conquered. In Persia, for example, most Mongols became Muslim. Elsewhere, Mongols either couldn’t absorb those they conquered or intentionally didn’t. In China, for example, Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis, dismissed the Confucian scholars, forbade marriage between Mongols and Chinese, and wouldn’t allow the Chinese to learn the Mongol language. Because the Chinese weren’t allowed to Mongolize, they didn’t. They kept their own identity, and when they nally kicked the Mongols out in 1368, the Chinese were able to establish the Ming Dynasty under traditional Chinese practices, which they had never lost. There were, however, two major consequences of Mongol rule. The rst is that Russia, which was conquered by the Golden Horde and treated as a vassal state, didn’t unify or culturally develop",
    "262": "as quickly as its European neighbors to the west. The second, and globally more important impact was that world trade, cultural diusion, and awareness grew. Think about it: The Mongol empire touched Europe and very nearly touched Japan. It stretched southward to Persia and India making possible not only trade but also the transmission of the Black Plague in the fourteenth century. This one empire touched nearly all the major civilizations of the day. So, strange as it sounds, the often brutal Mongols, in their own way, brought the world together. By 1450, as the Mongol Empire was well into its decline, the world would never again be disconnected. E. DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICA",
    "263": "The most signicant early civilizations in Africa for AP purposes were Egypt and Carthage, both of which were discussed in the previous chapter. Both of these civilizations were located in North Africa along the Mediterranean, north of the Sahara Desert. But there were other civilizations in Africa too. Some of them existed long before 600 C.E., but we’ve included them in this section (rather than in the previous chapter) so that you can study them as a group. Interaction Kush, Axum, and the Swahili Coast The Kush and Axum civilizations developed to the south of Egypt in the upper reaches of the Nile River. Kush developed at about the same time as ancient Egypt, and at one point around 750 B.C.E. actually conquered it. Less than a hundred years later, however, Kush retreated southward back to its capital at Meroe, where it became a center for ironworks and trade.",
    "264": "After the Kush decline around 200 C.E., another empire, Axum, rose to greatness to the south (in modern-day Ethiopia). Although Axum never conquered any other civilization, it traded with them frequently, especially ivory and gold. In the fourth century, Axum converted to Christianity, and in the seventh century, many converted to Islam. These conversions illustrate that the people of Axum were in constant contact with the empires of the Mediterranean world. And that contact has had a long-standing impact. Ethiopia’s large Christian community in present times is a direct result of the Axum conversion. Remember that this entire period is dominated by interactions. In addition to interaction with the Mediterranean world through the Red Sea, the eastern coast of Africa was linked to India and Southeast Asia through the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean trade. The east coast of Africa was populated by Bantu-speaking peoples who settled into lives of farmers, merchants, and shermen. This",
    "265": "area is known as the Swahili Coast, from the Arabic word for “coasters” or traders, and indeed the Swahili language is a mix of the original Bantu language supplemented by Arabic. Trade with the Muslims began in the early tenth century as Swahili traders brought gold, slaves, ivory, and other exotic products to the coast. The incredible wealth generated by this trade resulted in the growth of powerful kingdoms and trading cities along the coast in advantageous locations (see map). Like wealthy trading cities throughout the world, they became cultural and political centers. By the fteenth century, what had previously been mud and wooden out-posts had become impressive coral and stone mosques, public buildings, and fortified cities with trade goods from all over the world. To facilitate political and economic relationships, the ruling elites and merchant classes of the eastern African kingdoms converted to Islam, but maintained many of their own cultural traditions. Eventually, Islam",
    "266": "spread throughout most of East Africa. The Other Side of the Sand: Ghana, Mali, and Songhai Kush and Axum were in eastern Africa, along the Nile River and near the Red Sea. Therefore, they had easy access to other cultures. The cultures of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai, however, were in west Africa, south of the Sahara. When the Muslim Empire spread across North Africa in the seventh and eighth centuries, these African kingdoms began trading with the larger Mediterranean economy. Islamic traders penetrated the unforgiving Sahara desert and reached the fertile wealthy interior of Africa, called sub-Saharan (beneath the Sahara), while African traders pushed northward toward Carthage and Tripoli. Previously, the desert had acted as one gigantic “don’t-want-to-deal-with-it” barrier, so people typically didn’t. Increasingly, however, caravans of traders were willing to do what they had to do to get to the riches on the other side of the sand. At rst, the west Africans were in search of salt,",
    "267": "which they had little of but which existed in the Sahara. When they encountered the Islamic traders along the salt road, they started trading for a lot more than just salt. The consequence was an explosion of trade. Why were the Islamic traders so interested in trading with west African kingdoms? Because in Ghana (about 800–1000 C.E.) and Mali (about 1200–1450 C.E.), there was tons, and we mean tons, of gold. A little sand in your eyes was probably worth some gold in your hand. So the Islamic traders kept coming. The constant trade brought more than just Islamic goods to Ghana and Mali; it brought Islam. For Ghana the result was devastating. The empire was subjected to a Holy War led by an Islamic group intent on converting (or else killing) them. While Ghana was able to defeat the",
    "268": "empire was subjected to a Holy War led by an Islamic group intent on converting (or else killing) them. While Ghana was able to defeat the Islamic forces, their empire fell into decline. By the time the Mali came to power, the region had converted to Islam anyway, this time in a more peaceful transition. One of the greatest Mali rulers, Mansa Musa, built a capital at Timbuktu and expanded the kingdom well beyond the bounds of Ghana. In 1307, Musa made a pilgrimage to Mecca (remember the Five Pillars of Islam?) complete with an entourage of hundreds of gold-carrying servants and camels. The journey was so extravagant and so long and so impressive to everyone who saw it, that Musa became an overnight international sensation. Had the entertainment industry been fully established during that time, you can bet that Access Hollywood and US Weekly would have been all over the Musa moment. But the largest empire in west Africa was formed in the mid-fteenth century, when Songhai ruler Sonni Ali",
    "269": "conquered the entire region and established the Songhai Empire. The Songhai Empire lasted until around 1600 C.E., and during its reign, Timbuktu became a major cultural center, complete with a university that drew scholars from around the Islamic world. The Arts in Africa Oral literature was an important part of life in most African communities. History and stories were passed from one generation to the next, not through written texts, but through storytelling. But the storytelling wasn’t just grandpa sitting next to the re. It was a production akin to a dramatic performance. The stories were told the same way for so many generations that people knew the lines. Everyone was able to participate in the storytelling by reciting responses at the appropriate times. Think about what it’s like to watch Star Wars with a room full of people—parents, grandparents, kids—who’ve already seen it; that will give you a good sense of what oral literature meant to those cultures. Early sub-Saharan",
    "270": "African cultures are also known for their sculptures, particularly out of pottery and bronze. The Benin culture (near present-day Nigeria) mastered a bronze sculpting technique. They made clay molds around a wax carving, melted the wax, lled the mold with melted bronze, and, after breaking the clay mold, revealed some of the most beautiful early bronze work created by any civilization. F. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS",
    "271": "There were three great civilizations in what is now Central America and South America that developed before the arrival of the Europeans. One of the civilizations, the Maya, actually began around the time of the major classical civilizations and were discussed in the previous chapter. The other two civilizations, the Incas and Aztecs, were conquered by the Europeans after 1450. They will be discussed again in the next chapter. That said, we are including all three of them in this chapter so that you can review the cultural characteristics of these three civilizations in one place. We’ll talk about their conquests in the next chapter. Mayan Decline: Where Did They Go? As a review, the Maya were organized in city-states ruled by a single king. Their largely agricultural peasant population was bound to nobility by ties of loyalty and religion. They occupied poorly drained lowlands in Central America and adapted by building terraces to trap the silt drained by numerous rivers. Some of",
    "272": "these cities grew to be quite sizable—10,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, and engaged in long-distance trade as far north as central Mexico. But the cities were often at odds with one another and in Mayan territory, war was about capturing slaves or sacrificial victims. The decline of the Maya remains a source of debate. They began to abandon their cities around 800 C.E. Environmental degradation and overuse of land, political dissension and social unrest, natural disaster, and outside invaders have all been proposed as causes of their decline. The Aztecs: Trade and Sacrifice The Aztecs, also known as the Mexica, arrived in central Mexico in the mid-1200s and built their capital at Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City). More than anything else, the Aztecs are known for their expansionist policy and professional army, which allowed them to dominate nearby states and demand heavy taxes and captives. Warriors were the elite in the Aztec social structure (the majority of the people were peasants",
    "273": "and slaves). Through conquest and alliances, the Aztecs built an empire of some 12 million people. But despite the huge size, they",
    "274": "peasants and slaves). Through conquest and alliances, the Aztecs built an empire of some 12 million people. But despite the huge size, they didn’t use a bureaucratic form of government. The conquered areas were generally allowed to govern themselves, as long as they paid the tribute demanded of them. Roads were built to link the far-flung areas of the huge empire, and trade flourished. Aztec women had a subordinate public role but could inherit property. Like women in most all other traditional civilizations, Aztec women were primarily charged with running the household, but they were also involved in skilled crafts, especially weaving, and—to some extent—in commerce. Notably, the Aztec religious system was tied to the military because one of the purposes of the military was to obtain victims for human sacrice. Tens of thousands of men and women were killed annually; many would be sacriced simultaneously for an important religious occasion, such as the dedication of a new temple.",
    "275": "Compare Them: The Aztec Civilization and the Roman Empire Although the Aztecs and Romans developed large civilizations, continents and centuries apart, they were similar in at least two major respects. First, they tied together their vast empires by building roads. Second, they generally allowed the people they conquered to govern themselves, as long as they paid their taxes or tributes. Because of the improved transportation systems (roads) and the diversity of cultures under their control, both the Aztecs and the Romans were able to adapt ideas from the people they conquered and use them for their own purposes. In other words, the Aztecs and the Romans were conquerors, but also borrowers.",
    "276": "The Incas: My Land Is Your Land The Inca Empire, set in the Andes Mountains in Peru, was also expansionist in nature. At its zenith, it is thought to have controlled more than 2,000 miles of South American coastline. The Incas controlled this territory using a professional army, an established bureaucracy, a unied language, and a complex system of roads and tunnels. Like the Maya (and the Aztecs), the Incas had no large animals, so the prime source of labor was human. A large proportion of the population was peasants, who worked the land or on construction projects. They were expected to give a proportion of their harvest to support the ruling classes and to provide famine relief. These surpluses eventually became large enough to support large cities. The capital at Cuzco may have had as many as 300,000 people in the late 1400s. Incan women were expected to help work the elds, weave cloth, and care for the household. They could pass property on to their daughters and even played a role",
    "277": "in religion. The Incas were polytheistic, but the sun god was the most important and was at the center of the state religion. Like the Aztecs, the Incas practiced human sacrice, but in much smaller numbers, usually choosing instead to sacrice material goods or animals. Incan religion also had a very strong moral quality, emphasizing rewards for good behavior and punishments for bad. Like the Egyptians, Incan rulers were mummified after death and became intermediaries between the gods and the people. For the Incas, the concept of private property didn’t exist. Rather, the ruler was viewed as having descended from the sun and therefore owning everything on Earth. The military was very important because each new ruler needed to ensure his place in eternity by securing new land, and that meant conquest. There was a state bureaucracy, manned by the nobility, which controlled the empire by traveling on a complex system of roads. The Inca were excellent builders, stone cutters, and miners.",
    "278": "Their skills are evident from the ruins of the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco and the temples of Machu Picchu. They never developed a system of writing. However, they were able to record census data and keep an accounting of harvests on quipu, a set of knotted strings. IV. REVIEW OF INTERACTIONS AMONG CULTURES 600 C.E.–1450 The purpose of this section is to help you pull together the history from this time period and view it from a global perspective. The examples below are by no means an exhaustive list of the ways that civilizations or groups of people interacted from 600 to 1450 C.E. To the contrary, they are examples that serve as a starting point in your studies. We strongly suggest that you add examples to the ones below as you work your way through this review and your materials from your class. A. TRADE NETWORKS AND CULTURAL DIFFUSION Trade has always been a big deal historically speaking. Getting stu and buying stu is a huge incentive behind interactions. If you have everything",
    "279": "you need and want, you can live in isolation. If you don’t, and somebody else down the road has what you want, you’ve got two choices: take it or trade for it. If you’re not into the whole conquest thing, then trading is probably your best option. From 600 to 1450, trade exploded onto the world scene—so much so that the world after 1450 is inseparable from global interaction. Let’s quickly review the global trade routes that you read about in this chapter.",
    "280": "The Mediterranean Trade between western Europe, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic Empire The Hanseatic League (more details below) The Silk Road (used heavily again from about 1200 C.E. until about 1600 C.E.—see next page) The land routes of the Mongols Trade between China and Japan Trade between India and Persia The Trans-Saharan trade routes between west Africa and the Islamic Empire\n\nRemember, too, that trade was not only aided by better boats and better roads, but also by monetary systems, lines of credit, and accounting methods that helped business boom. Record-keeping and money management is key. If you’re able to keep records or borrow money, you are by denition establishing a business relationship that extends into the future. Once you start thinking about a regular business-trade relationship extending into the future, you can get people to invest in that future, and pretty soon the wheels of international business are going ’round and ’round.",
    "281": "The trade routes are important, of course, not just because of their impact on business, but also because of their role in cultural diusion. It is over the trade routes that religions and languages spread. It is over the trade routes that literature and art and ideas spread. And, unfortunately, it is over the trade routes that disease and plague sometimes spread. The Bubonic Plague (also called the Black Death) started in Asia in the fourteenth century and was carried by merchants along the trade routes all the way to Europe, where it destroyed entire communities and killed as many as one out of every three people in western Europe. The plague quickened the decline of feudal society because many manors weren’t able to function. In addition to the trade routes mentioned above, there’s one that we haven’t mentioned yet—the Indian Ocean Trade. It’s important, so we’ll go into it in some detail. Indian Ocean Trade Throughout the period covered in this chapter, the Persians and the Arabs",
    "282": "dominated the Indian Ocean Trade. Their trade routes connected ports in western India to ports in the Persian Gulf, which in turn were connected to ports in eastern Africa. Unlike boats that were used on the Mediterranean Sea, boats that sailed the Indian Ocean were, necessarily, more resilient to the large waves common in those waters. The traders learned to understand the monsoon seasons and direction of the winds, and scheduled their voyages accordingly. Despite these diculties, the Indian Ocean trade routes were relatively safe, especially when compared to those on the Mediterranean, where constant warfare was a problem. Since sailors often married the local women at the ends of their trade routes, cultures started to intermix rapidly. Many sailors took foreign wives home and created bilingual and bicultural families. More on the Silk Road You already know that the Silk Road connected China to the Mediterranean cultures even way back in the early days of the Roman Empire. You also",
    "283": "need to know that the Silk Road was used heavily again from about 1200 C.E. until about 1600 C.E., during the reign of the Mongols. The important thing to know about the Silk Road is that it carried so much more than silk. It carried porcelain and paper. It carried military technologies. It carried religions, such as Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. It carried food. Because it extended so far and was used for so long, it’s safe to say that East met West on the Silk Road. It’s impossible to have a discussion about international trade and cultural diffusion without mentioning it by name. More on the Hanseatic League As you already know, the Hanseatic League was a collection of city-states in the Baltic and North Sea regions of Europe that banded together in 1241 to establish common trade practices, ght o pirates and foreign governments, and essentially establish a trade monopoly from the region to much of the rest of the world. It worked for a few hundred years. More than 100 cities",
    "284": "joined the league. The result was enormous for two reasons. First, it resulted in a substantial middle class in northern Europe, a development that would drive changes in that region in later centuries (more on that in the next chapter). Second, it set a precedent for large, European trading operations that profoundly aected the Dutch and the English, which would also deeply affect the world in later centuries. Was There a Global Trade Network? If you think about it, after about 1200 C.E. or so, the world was very interconnected. Europe was trading with the Islamic world and Russia. The Islamic world was trading with Africa, India, and China. India was trading with China and eastern Africa. China was trading with Japan and southeast Europe. If you link up all the trade routes, goods could make their way from England to Persia to India to Japan. They could also travel to points north and south, from Muscovy to Mali. The global network wasn’t entirely controlled by one entity or laid out",
    "285": "by one trading organization. It was more like a web of interconnected but highly independent parts. It required lots of managers at each site. It required people to be linked up through third and even fourth parties. No one person was managing it, and yet almost all major civilizations (except those in the Americas) were a part of it. In short, it was like the Internet, only in geographic space instead of cyberspace. B. EXPANSION OF RELIGION AND EMPIRE: CULTURE CLASH One of the most signicant inuences on cultural interaction and diusion has been the expansion of empires and the intentional diusion of religion. Keep in mind that when we say intentional diusion of religion, we mean methods like missionary work or religious warfare. This is opposed to the natural spread of religious ideas that occurs when people come into contact with each other, like over the trade routes.",
    "286": "is opposed to the natural spread of religious ideas that occurs when people come into contact with each other, like over the trade routes.\n\nHere’s a quick listing of some of the examples discussed in this chapter.\n\nThe Mongol expansion into Russia, Persia, India, and China The Germanic tribes into southern Europe and England The Vikings’ expansion from Scandinavia into England and western Europe The Magyars’ push from eastern Europe into western Europe The Islamic Empire’s push into Spain, India, and Africa The Crusades Buddhist missionaries to Japan Orthodox Christian missionaries into eastern Europe",
    "287": "When you think about it, the bulk of this chapter is about two things: the expansion of religion and empires leading to cultural contact, or the relative isolationism that resulted under the feudal systems in Europe and Japan. Another way to encapsulate this period: a time fueled by conquest and religious expansion. We’ve talked a lot about the eorts of expansionists that succeeded. We need to give you some more details about the efforts of some expansionists that didn’t succeed, namely, the crusaders. The Playground Isn’t Big Enough for Two Bullies: Crusaders and Jihad You’ll recall that in the Middle Ages, the Islamic Empire expanded, and the Moors conquered much of Spain. The Christians felt threatened by the expansion of the Muslims, especially as Islam became entrenched in areas that the Christians identied with historically. So, in 1096 C.E. Pope Urban initiated the First Crusade in response to the success of the Seljuk Turks, who took control of the Holy Land (present-day Israel",
    "288": "and Palestine). The Pope wanted Jerusalem, the most important city in Christianity, to be in the hands of Christians. He was also hoping that the eorts would help reunite the Roman Catholic Church with the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople, which had split apart 50 years before the start of the crusades. The crusaders immediately set out to conquer the Holy Land, and initially captured several cities, including Antioch and, most important, Jerusalem. However, both cities quickly fell back into the hands of the Arabs. Through the year 1204 C.E., a total of four crusades failed to produce results, and the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church separated even further (ve more crusades followed, but were not successful in achieving major goals). As mentioned earlier, in the Fourth Crusade the Catholic Church sacked Constantinople and established a short-lived Latin Empire there (most of the crusaders either died or returned to Europe). The impact on the Holy Land was",
    "289": "violence and uncertainty. Most of the region remained in the hands of the Muslim Arabs, and the whole mess led to centuries of mistrust and intolerance between Christians and Muslims. As you think about global interaction through conquest, there’s much to point out about the Crusades. First, the Crusades were not only motivated by religious beliefs and purposes. There were economic and political incentives as well. No doubt there were some who fought for religious reasons, especially in the early crusades, but the lure of empire and wealth was certainly a major factor for many. Second, even to the extent that it was a religious eort, the Crusades illustrate that religion, when combined with conquest and feelings of superiority, can be a very bloody enterprise. The death, rape, pillaging, and slavery perpetrated in the name of religion was startling. The same, of course, was true of Islamic conquests in India, Persia, and Africa. Because the religiously devout are sometimes willing to",
    "290": "be martyred for their beliefs, intentional religious expansionism can be just as devastating and powerful as a politically driven military invasion. Third, and perhaps most importantly for the AP, the Crusades prove that even the eorts of conquest and expansion that fail to reach their goals still have a major impact on world history: They lead to interaction between cultures that might not otherwise interact. The Crusades put Europe back into the sphere of the Eastern Mediterranean for centuries. That interaction fueled trade and an exchange of ideas. It also led to western Europe’s rediscovery of its ancient past, which was being preserved by the Byzantine and Islamic Empires. That rediscovery fueled huge changes in Europe, which we’ll talk about in the next chapter. C. OTHER REASONS PEOPLE WERE ON THE MOVE Interaction among and within civilizations occurred during this period in history for many reasons other than trade or conquest. As populations grew, people needed more room to",
    "291": "spread out. This not only led to huge movements of people, like the Germanic tribes into southern Europe, but also to more crowded conditions on the manor or in small towns. The result was the burgeoning of ever-larger cities; once the cities became larger, more opportunities were created there, which pulled more and more people in from the countryside. Some cities grew not just because of a general population increase, but because they were intentionally established as centers of civilization. Think about the empires in this chapter. The eastern Roman Empire, which of course became the Byzantine Empire, was specically headquartered at Constantinople, which was specically built as a center to draw people. In fact, capitals were moved all the time to create an aura of a rising empire. The Islamic Empire moved to Baghdad under the Abbasid Dynasty. The Fujiwara moved the capital of Japan to Heian. The Mongols built a city at Samarkand, as did the Malians at Timbuktu, and the Maya at",
    "292": "Tikal. The list goes on and on. Every time an empire built a new city to aunt itself, it drew thousands of people. This is true especially to the degree that these civilizations built universities, which by their nature drew people from around the empire. That meant people who weren’t living in the same city in the past were now living together. The result? More cultural diffusion. Pilgrimages were a third reason that people during this time period were constantly on the move. Rome and Constantinople certainly attracted thousands to their grand cathedrals, but the Islamic duty to travel to Mecca was no doubt the most significant destination of religious pilgrimages. Imagine the thousands upon thousands who traveled from the vast reaches of the Islamic world. Imagine the amount of cultural diffusion that occurred as a result. Just think of Mansa Musa and you’ll be convinced. V. TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS 600 C.E.–1450 Once again, it is interaction that leads to innovation. This period",
    "293": "is marked by expanding trade, expanding empires and expanding interactions. All lead to increased wealth, frequent cultural borrowing, and the development of new ideas. Many of these new innovations came from the eastern societies–China and India, ltered through the Islamic world. By 1450, most of these new ideas had made their way back to Europe, following the Crusaders, merchants, and missionaries.",

Some of these would result in great",
    "295": "environmental changes, influence trade networks, and motivate exploration and conquest. VI. CHANGES AND CONTINUITIES IN THE ROLE OF WOMEN The spread of Islam, the openness of Christianity and Buddhism, the development of new empires based on wealth and acquisition of property, and the revitalization of neo-Confucianism impacted the status of women around the world. Continuing from the previous time period, restrictions on women’s freedoms depended on which caste or class they belonged to. At the upper-most levels, a woman could overcome the status of her gender and assume leadership roles if there was no male heir or if the male heir was very young. But generally, as societies became more urban and wealthy, women, especially those of the elite or upper classes had their freedoms further restricted even as their status in society rose. This can be seen in the increased veiling of women in the Islamic world, the custom of foot-binding in neo- Confucian China, and the young age of",
    "296": "marriage in South Asia. Trade and the arrival of new religions did not signicantly change the role of women in African societies—as pastoral nomads many of the African societies were relatively egalitarian. Even when sedentary lifestyles developed, women had a great deal of freedom and societies were often matrilineal and matriarchal. Women commanded a bride-price rather than having to give a dowry, and were considered a valuable source of wealth. “Mother of the King” was a political oce in many African societies and women participated in specic religious rituals controlled solely by women. Although both Islam and Christianity found converts in Africa, women were less eager to convert than men and the practice of veiling was met with mixed reactions. Changes in the status and role of women included access to more education as societies continued to prosper and interact. This is true of the Confucian cultures of China and Japan, where women were highly literate and expected to",
    "297": "understand proper virtue and their role in the household. But overall, even when educated and wealthy, most women had far less power than their male counterparts and were subject to any number of cultural and legal restrictions.",

    "305": "VII. PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER In the previous section, we hope that you were able to pull a lot of the history from this time period together in some meaningful ways, especially as it relates to cultural interaction. There’s no question that the spread and growth of religion had enormous consequences during this time period. That should be clear to you. There’s also no question that the issue of centralization verses noncentralization seems to have an impact on a civilization. Look at what it meant for Europe, or for Japan, or China, or India. But beyond the issues of interaction, centralization, and the growth of religion, there’s also something else you should be thinking about: how to organize the world in your head. In modern times, we have clear boundaries between countries. But in addition to using those political boundaries, we talk of cultural regions all the time. We’ll say things like “the West” or “the East.” That’s ne, but where’s the dividing line? Is modern-day Russia part",
    "306": "of the East or the West? What about Saudi Arabia? What about Japan? In addition, we’ll split even our own country into manageable pieces that don’t have specic, exact geographic boundaries. We’ll say “the South” and what we’re referring to is a culture more than a place. Is Florida part of “the South?” Northern Florida probably is, but the rest of Florida has a very different feel. We bring all this up because this kind of stu is a big deal for the AP test writers. Sometimes it’s easier to think about and write about history in terms of cultural areas, rather than political boundaries. “The Muslim World,” for example, would mean not just countries that are predominately Muslim, but communities or individuals within non-Muslim countries who participate in the culture of Islam. Or think about the “Jewish community.” In the time period covered by this chapter, Jews were scattered throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia. There was no Jewish state, only a Jewish culture. Yet, the Jewish culture",
    "307": "maintained its identity. In terms of the era that you’ve just reviewed, you might want to think of the world in terms of major cultural divisions. Religions help. You can think of developments in the Christian sphere, the Islamic sphere, the Hindu sphere, and the Buddhist sphere. But then don’t forget that some of these spheres overlap, and some of them coexist with other religions or belief systems (Confucianism and Buddhism, for example). You can also think of developments in terms of expanding empires and feudal systems. Or even more generally, think of the world in terms of cultures that interacted and those that didn’t. However you choose to think about the world in terms of cultural areas or structural similarities, the important thing is that you try to analyze the history. Doing so will force you to make comparisons and contrasts among the cultures. And doing that will get your brain cranking in the way the AP exam will expect you to demonstrate. The more you think about how",

There are lots of legitimate answers to these questions, and the content of this chapter will help you think about some of them. 2. What were some of the difierences among the ways in which non-European cultures interacted with Europe? What inuences contributed to these difierences? What were the consequences? You’ll notice that European powers penetrated difierent parts of the globe to difierent degrees.

    "320": "III. MAJOR EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENTS 1450–1750 During the three centuries covered in this chapter, profound changes occurred on the European continent. These changes afiected life on all levels: the way people viewed themselves (their past, their present, and their future potential), the way governments viewed their authority, the way religion intersected with politics and individuality, and the way Europeans thought about and interacted with the rest of the world. By the end of these 300 years, the European countries will have used their new technologies, new ideas of governing, and new forms economic organization to become the dominant world powers. Much of their success was based on competition and rivalry as they raced to secure faster trade routes, new colonial possessions, and attempted to gain control of key resources. And much of their success came at the expense of the land-based empires of Asia and the declining empires in the Americas. So while the previous chapter was all about",
    "321": "interactions, this one covers the period of European maritime empire-building that resulted from those initial interactions across Asia and the Indian Ocean As you review the enormous developments in Parts A and B below, think about how they were linked together and impacted each other. A. REVOLUTIONS IN EUROPEAN THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION By the 1300s, much of Europe had been Christian for a thousand years. The feudal system had dominated the political and social structures for five hundred years, and the ancient classical civilizations of Greece and Rome had been almost entirely forgotten. Life in the Middle Ages was dominated by local issues, concern for salvation, territorial disputes, the Black Death, a lack of education outside monasteries, and small-scale trade. As you read in the last chapter, near the end of the Middle Ages, countries began to unify under centralized rule. The Crusades exposed Christians to the advanced Islamic civilizations, increased trade fueled contact with",
    "322": "other parts of the world, and universities became great centers of learning. This increased contact with foreign powers, and scholasticism exposed Europeans not only to developments in the rest of the world but also to history. Recall that the Byzantine and Islamic Empires had preserved much of the heritage of ancient Greece and Rome, even as they built unique civilizations of their own and made huge contributions to ancient texts, especially in the areas of mathematics and science. As Europe expanded its worldview and interacted more frequently with these two empires, it rediscovered its own past. The combination of a rediscovered past and a productive present led to major changes in the way Europeans viewed the world and themselves. These new perspectives led to four massive cultural movements: the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. These revolutions in expression and thought changed the world. In a span of just a few hundred",
    "323": "years, Europe went from being a backward, isolated, self-involved outpost on the perimeter of the major civilizations to the east to the dominant civilization in the world. We’ll talk about the details of European global exploration and expansion later in this chapter. In the meantime, you should understand that this exploration and expansion were partly causing—and partly caused by—the major developments in thought and expression that are listed below. 1. The Renaissance: Classical Civilization Part II After the Black Death abated and the population of Europe once again began to swell, the demand for goods and services began to increase rapidly. Individuals moved to the cities. A middle class made up of bankers, merchants, and traders emerged due to increased global trade. In short, Europe experienced an inux of money to go along with its newfound sense of history. It shouldn’t be too surprising that a sizeable chunk of this money was spent on recapturing and studying the past.",
    "324": "Humanism: A Bit More Focus on the Here and Now In medieval Europe, thoughts of salvation and the afterlife so dominated personal priorities that life on Earth was, for many, something to be sufiered through on the way to heaven rather than lived through as a pursuit of its own. As Europeans rediscovered ancient texts, they were struck with the degree that humanity—personal accomplishment and personal happiness—formed the central core of so much of the literature and philosophy of the ancient writers. The emphasis began to shift from fulfillment in the afterlife to participating in the here-and- now. This is not to say that Europeans suddenly became hedonistic, focused only on worldly pleasures. To the contrary, the Catholic Church and a focus on the afterlife remained dominant. However, Europeans were fascinated with the ancient Greek and Roman concepts of beauty and citizenship, and as a consequence they began to shift their focus to life on Earth and to celebrating human achievements",
    "325": "in the scholarly, artistic, and political realms. This focus on human endeavors became known as humanism. Its impact was far-reaching because a focus on present-day life leads to a focus on individuals, and a focus on individuality inevitably leads to a reduction in the authority of institutions.",
    "326": "The Arts Stage a Comeback The Renaissance literally means “rebirth,” and this was nowhere more apparent than in the arts. In Italy, where powerful families in city- states such as Florence, Venice, and Milan became rich on trade, art was financed on a scale not seen since the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome. The Medici family in Florence, for example, not only ruled the great city and beyond (several family members not coincidentally became popes!), but turned it into a showcase of architecture and beauty by acting as patron for some of the greatest artists of the time, including Michelangelo and Brunelleschi. Unlike medieval paintings, which depicted humans as at, stifi, and out of proportion with their surroundings, paintings of the Renaissance demonstrated the application of humanistic ideals learned from the ancients. Painters and sculptors such as Leonardo da Vinci and Donatello depicted the human figure as realistically as possible. Careful use of light and shadow made",
    "327": "figures appear full and real. Many artists were so committed to this realism that they viewed and participated in autopsies to fully understand the structure of the human body. Artists also employed a technique known as linear perspective, developed by Tommaso Masaccio and Fillipo Brunelleschi, in which nearby objects were drawn bigger while far objects were drawn smaller; the lines of perspective merged into a distant focal point, giving the painting a three- dimensional quality. This use of perspective was a huge development toward realism. The Catholic Church noticed the developments in artistic techniques, and soon the greatest artists were hard at work adorning the great palaces and cathedrals of Italy. For four years, 1508 to 1512 C.E., Michelangelo painted the now-famous ceiling of the Sistine Chapel while lying on his back on scafiolding. Meanwhile, Renaissance architects borrowed heavily from the Greek and Roman traditions to build huge domes on cathedrals in Florence and",

The artistic movement that engulfed the Italian city-states also spread northward and westward through much of western Europe, although it was generally more subdued and often more religious there than it was on the Italian peninsula. Still, even in northern Europe, especially in artistic centers such as Flanders, the inuences of the resurgent Western heritage could be felt. For example, the Dutch Van Eyck brothers and the German painter Albrecht Durer adopted the naturalism of the Italian painters and gained fame as portraitists. While highly realistic in style, most northern paintings were religiously motivated, and therefore even secular paintings or portraits were filled with religiously symbolic objects and color choices that resonated with the Christian faithful. Still, while the northern painters and sculptors were quite talented, they were outnumbered and in many cases outdone by their Italian counterparts. The bigger contribution of the northern Renaissance came not from",
    "329": "the visual arts, but from literature.",
    "330": "Contrast Them: Art in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Medieval art was almost entirely religious; Renaissance art was religious and secular, combining both Christian and humanist elements. Medieval art existed mostly in cathedrals; Renaissance art was commissioned by both religious and secular leaders, and adorned public plazas and homes. Medieval art was at and stifi; Renaissance art was realistic, softer, and more human. In short, Medieval art didn’t try to be worldly; Renaissance art tried very much to be of this world.",
    "331": "Western Writers Finally Get Readers Although printing was developed in China centuries earlier (remember which dynasty? The Song), moveable type wasn’t invented in Europe until the mid-1400s, when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press. Prior to Gutenberg’s invention, the creation of books was such a long and laborious task that few were made. Those that were made were usually printed in Latin, the language of scholars and the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, the typical person didn’t read. With the invention of the printing press, all that changed. Books became easy to produce and thus were far more afiordable.

More books led to more literate and educated people. The newly literate people desired more books, which continued to make them more educated, which again increased their desire for books, and so on. Many of the first books and pamphlets that were published were practical or political in nature. In 1517 C.E., Machiavelli, for example, published The Prince, a how-to book for monarchs who wanted to maintain their power. The work had a profound impact because it suggested that monarchy should be distinct from the church and that a leader should act purely in self-interest of the state rather than on the basis of vague moral tenets (since then, the term Machiavellian often has a negative connotation, implying a ruler who is ruthlessly selfish, scheming, and manipulative). But the printed word extended",

Books were printed for no purpose other than entertainment or diversion, and this led to literature that increasingly focused on the daily lives of regular people, and humanized traditional institutions such as the military or the nobility. Literature blossomed in the Renaissance of northern Europe, especially in the Low Countries (today known as the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium) and in England. In the early sixteenth century, Erasmus, one of the most well-known learned men of the time, counseled kings and popes. He wrote In Praise of Folly, which satirized what he thought were the most foolish political moves to date. At around the same time, Sir Thomas More of England wrote Utopia, which described an ideal society, in which everyone shared the wealth, and everyone’s needs were met. More and Erasmus were Christian humanists, meaning that they expressed",

The Renaissance also produced William Shakespeare, arguably the most famous European writer from this time. Shakespeare’s works reected the period well because they not only exemplified humanism in its extreme—focusing on character strengths and flaws, comedy and tragedy—but also illustrated the era’s obsession with the politics and mythology of classical civilization. His play Julius Caesar and his poem Venus and Adonis are among his many works that explored the Classical world. 2. The Protestant Reformation: Streamlining Salvation You might recall from the previous chapter that during the Middle Ages (600–1450), the Roman Catholic Church was an extremely powerful force in Europe. While political power was difiused under the feudal system, and while the various European princes and political powers frequently clashed with the pope, emperors and princes knew that",
    "335": "their power increased if the church blessed their reign. As a consequence, the pope wielded considerable political power. The church was the one institution that the people of western Europe had in common. It was a unifying force, an institution believed to be sanctioned by God. With such widely accepted credentials, the church held itself out as not only the undisputed authority on all things otherworldly, but also the ultimate endorsement on all things worldly. With one foot on Earth and the other in heaven, the pope—and with him the hierarchy of the Catholic Church—acted as the intermediary between man and God. Nearly everyone in Europe understood this clearly: To get to heaven, you had to proceed by way of the Catholic Church. The church understood the power it had over the faithful. When it needed to finance its immense building projects plus pay for the huge number of Renaissance artists it kept in its employ, it began to sell indulgences. An indulgence was a piece of paper that",
    "336": "the faithful could purchase to reduce time in purgatory (the place Roman Catholics believed they would go after death). There, they would expiate (look it up!) their sins and then be allowed to enter heaven. Because purgatory was not a happy place to go, people greatly valued the concept of reducing their time there. Selling indulgences was not only a means of generating income but also a way for the church to maintain power over the masses. During this time, land-owning nobles grew increasingly resentful of the church, which had amassed an enormous amount of power and wealth and exploited a huge number of resources at the expense of the nobles. This resentment and mistrust fueled anti-church sentiments. The selling of indulgences propelled the frustration into the ranks of the peasant class and helped set the stage for confrontation. The selling of indulgences also confirmed to many the corrupt nature of the church. Martin Luther: Monk on a Mission In 1517, a German monk named Martin",
    "337": "Luther supposedly nailed a list of 95 theses on a church door—a list that was distributed quickly and widely by aid of the new-fangled printing press. His list outlined his frustrations with current church practices, including the church’s practice of selling indulgences, which he said amounted to selling salvation for profit. Luther’s frustrations had been building for some time. He had traveled to Rome, and was unnerved by the worldly nature of the city and the Vatican (the seat of the Catholic Church), which was in the midst of getting a Renaissance makeover—upgrades that were clearly paid for with money from churchgoers in far-away places. Among Luther’s many complaints was his insistence that church services should be conducted in the local languages of the people, not in Latin, a language that the German people didn’t understand. To help in this efiort, he translated the Bible into German so that it could be read and interpreted by everyone, as opposed to making people dependent",

Luther’s most significant claim was that salvation was given directly by God through grace, not through indulgences, and not through the authorization of the church. In other words, Luther suggested that the Bible teaches that people could appeal directly to God for forgiveness for sins and salvation. This revolutionary concept significantly reduced the role of the church as the exclusive middleman between God and man. In essence, the church was marginalized to an aid for salvation as opposed to the grantor of salvation. Pope Leo X was outraged, and ordered Luther to recant, or formally retract, his theses. Meanwhile, Luther’s ideas were spreading through much of northern Europe as the printing presses continued to roll. When Luther refused to recant, he was excommunicated. When he was allowed to address church leaders and princes at an assembly in Worms (1521), he refused to abandon his convictions. The pope called for his arrest, but a",

Luther’s followers began to refer to themselves as Lutherans, and began to separate themselves from the Catholic Church. What’s more, other theologians began to assert their own biblical interpretations, some of which were consistent with Luther’s; others were wildly different. Once the floodgates were opened, Luther had no control over the consequences. John Calvin from France led a powerful Protestant group by preaching an ideology of predestination. Calvinist doctrine stated that God had predetermined an ultimate destiny for all people, most of whom God had already damned. Only a few, he preached, would be saved, and those people were known as the Elect.

When the pope denied an annulment of the marriage, Henry VIII renounced Rome and declared himself the head of religious afiairs in England. This sat well with those in England who already were becoming Protestants, but much of England remained Catholic. Nevertheless, Henry pushed forward and presided over what was called the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church.

While previous skirmishes between the pope and the nobles had been about papal political authority, Luther’s challenges were theologically based and directed at the pope’s religious role. Luther asserted that the people did not need the Catholic Church, or its priests, in order to interact with God; they only needed their Bibles. If the religious authority of the pope could be so openly and brazenly challenged, and commonly accepted understandings of God’s relationship to man could be re-evaluated and rearticulated, then people’s understanding of other concepts might need to be re-evaluated as well. Put simply, by challenging the pope, Luther made it acceptable to question the conventional wisdom of the church.

At first, the Catholic Church responded inefiectively to the new religious trends. But when Luther refused to recant and German princes started to convert to Lutheranism, the Catholic Church began to institute reforms, which were led by Spain, a dedicated Catholic country. By banning the sale of indulgences, consulting more frequently with bishops and parishes, and training its priests to live the Catholic life instead of merely preaching it, the Catholic Church regained some of its lost credibility. However, make no mistake, the counter-reformation was as much about rearming as it was about reforming, and the church made it clear that it was not bowing to Protestant demands, but rather",

The Jesuits practiced self-control and moderation, believing that prayer and good works led to salvation. The pious example of the Jesuits led to a stricter training system and higher expectations of morality for the clergy. Because of their oratorical and political skills, many Jesuits were appointed by kings to high palace positions. A group of church ocials known as the Council of Trent presided over the counter-reform period from 1545 to 1563, dictating and defining the Catholic interpretation of religious doctrine and clarifying the Catholic Church’s position on important religious questions, such as the nature of salvation.

The Scientific Revolution: Prove It or Lose It Prior to the Scientific Revolution, Europe and most of the world believed, as Aristotle asserted, that Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun, stars, and planets revolved around the earth. There certainly were numerous inconsistencies observed by scientists with regard to this theory, but most scientists continued to attempt explaining the inconsistency rather than investigating the theory itself. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church and the political structure reinforced the lack of scientific investigation. The church focused everyone’s attention on salvation, while the feudal system focused everyone’s attention on mundane, local concerns. In other words, the lives of the vast majority of Europeans, including the nobility, were not engaged in big-picture concepts beyond military conquest and eternal",

But as Europe changed dramatically due to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, and as the growth of universities gave structure to burgeoning questions about the world, educated Europeans began to examine the world around them with new vigor. The results were revolutionary. The Copernican Revolution: A Revolution About Revolutions Just as the counter-reformation was gaining momentum, Nicolaus Copernicus developed a mathematical theory that asserted that the earth and the other celestial bodies revolved around the sun and that the earth also rotated on its axis daily. This was pretty shocking stufi to many in the “establishment.” Although most educated people had accepted the world was a sphere for centuries, even well before Columbus’s voyage in 1492, the earth’s position at the center of the universe was widely accepted. Copernicus’s heliocentric theory of the solar system brought about much debate, and much skepticism. In 1543, Copernicus published The",

The church put Galileo on trial before the Inquisition in Rome for heresy and he was forced to recant. His book was placed on The Index, a list of banned heretical works (where, astonishingly, it remained until 1822!). Nevertheless, while under house arrest, Galileo continued to research and document his findings. The Scientific Method: In Search of Truth Recall that during the High Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, the scholastic method of reasoning was deemed the most reliable means of determining scientific meaning. Scholasticism was based on Aristotelianism and therefore used reason as the chief method",
    "352": "of determining truth. Sometimes reason led to heresies, other times reason was used to explain and complement faith, as was the case with Thomas Aquinas. The scientific method was born out of the scholastic tradition, but it took it to considerable new levels. Reason alone wasn’t good enough. Under the scientific method, one had to prove what the mind concluded, document it, repeat it for others, and open it up to experimentation. At its highest stage, the scientific method required that any underlying principles be proven with mathematical precision. Copernicus and Galileo, of course, were two fathers of the scientific method, but it took more than a century for the method to be widely used. There were many contributors. Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) built an observatory and recorded his observations, and Francis Bacon (1561– 1626) published works on inductive logic. Both asserted that scientists should amass all the data possible through experimentation and observation and that the proper",

Sir Isaac Newton took it one step further. In The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1697), he invented calculus to help prove the theories of Copernicus, Galileo, Bacon, and others. He also developed the law of gravity. Together, these men and others developed a widely used system of observation, reason, experiment, and mathematical proof that could be applied to every conceivable scientific inquiry. With precise scientific instruments, like the microscope and the telescope, a scientist could retest what another scientist had originally tested. Many scientific inquires were conducted with practical goals in mind, such as the creation of labor-saving machines or the development of power sources from water and wind. Francis Bacon, for example, argued that science was pursued not for science’s sake but as a way to improve the human",

In the meantime, however, you need to understand that the Scientific Revolution led to a major rift in society. While many Christians were able to hold on to their beliefs even as they studied science, many also began to reject the church’s rigid pronouncements that conicted with scientific findings. Many of these people either became atheists (who believe that no god exists) or Deists (who believe that God exists but plays a passive role in life). Deism: God as a Watchmaker The Scientific Revolution contributed to a belief system known as deism, which became popular in the 1700s. The deists believed in a powerful god who created and presided over an orderly realm but who did not interfere in its workings. The deists viewed God as a watchmaker, one who set up the world, gave it natural laws by which to operate, and then let it run by itself (under natural laws that could be proved",

Because the U.S. Constitution has since been a model for so many others across the globe, so for this reason alone, it’s safe to say that the writers of the Enlightenment period changed the world. Keep this in mind when you move on to Chapter 9 and the Atlantic Revolutions. First a Little Background: Divine Right During the High Middle Ages and through the Renaissance and counter-reformation, the church allied itself with strong monarchs. These monarchs came to power by centralizing authority, uniting people under a common banner of nationalism, forming empires by promoting exploration and colonization (much more on this later), and",

Monarchs became convinced that God had ordained their right to govern, and that meant that people had a moral and religious obligation to obey them. This concept was known as the divine right of monarchs. James I of England, who ruled from 1603 to 1625, summed it up this way: “The king is from God and the law is from the King.” His statement made it pretty clear that an illegal act was an ungodly act. Because the pope also claimed to be ordained by God, the question of ultimate authority became very confusing indeed. During the Reformation, monarchs who resented the power of the church supported the reformists (Luther, Calvin, and others). Other monarchs, particularly in Spain and France, allied themselves with the church during the counter-reformation. In both cases, monarchs claimed to have divine right.

If they didn’t rule justly and live up to their responsibility, heaven would ensure their fall. Divine Right, on the other hand, was used to justify absolute rule without any corresponding responsibilities. Monarchs who ruled under a strict theory of Divine Right saw themselves as God’s personal representatives, chosen specifically for the task of ruling. In other words, Divine Right was a privilege without any corresponding responsibilities, whereas the Mandate of Heaven was upheld only so long as rulers acted justly.",

The social contract held that governments were formed not by divine decree, but to meet the social and economic needs of the people being governed. Philosophers who supported the social contract theory reasoned that because individuals existed before governments did, governments arose to meet the needs of the people, not the other way around. Still, because difierent philosophers looked at human nature differently, they disagreed about the role of government in the social contract. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), who wrote Leviathan, thought that people by nature were greedy and prone to violent warfare. Accordingly, he believed the role of the government under the social contract should be to preserve peace and stability at all costs. Hobbes therefore advocated an",

Locke also believed that all men were born equal to one another and had natural and unalienable rights to life, liberty, and property. Since mankind was good and rational, and thus capable of self-rule, Locke believed the primary responsibility of the government under the social contract was to secure and guarantee these natural rights. If, however, the government ever violated this trust, thus breaking the social contract, the people were justified in revolting and replacing the government.

He argues the essence of freedom is to obey laws that people prescribe for themselves. Needless to say, Rousseau’s beliefs not only had a tremendous efiect on revolutionary movements in the colonies of the European empires, but also inspired the anti-slavery movement. In addition to philosophers, there were many Enlightenment writers. Voltaire espoused the idea of religious toleration. Montesquieu argued for separation of powers among branches of government.

To be sure, they still ruled absolutely, but they internalized the Enlightenment philosophy and made attempts to tolerate diversity, increase opportunities for serfs, and take on the responsibilities that their rule required.

In 1488, Portugal financed a voyage by Bartholomew Dias who rounded the tip of Africa (which became known as the Cape of Good Hope). In 1497, Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, explored the east African kingdoms, and then went all the way to India, where he established trade relations. Shortly thereafter, Spain, which had recently been unified under Isabella and Ferdinand, wanted in on the action.

He sailed, found Cuba and the islands that came to be known as the West Indies, and the exploration of the Americas was underway. By 1494, Portugal and Spain were already fighting over land in the newly found Americas. To resolve their difierences, the two countries drew up the Treaty of Tordesillas, which established a line of demarcation on a longitudinal (north-south) line that runs through the western Atlantic Ocean. They agreed that everything to the east of the line belonged to Portugal; everything to the west belonged to Spain.

In addition, merchants wanted protection for their trade routes, which could also be acquired through allegiance to a particular sovereignty.

Because so many of the deaths occurred in the first few years, the Spaniards were able to seize control of the empire by around 1525. A similar fate met the Inca Empire. In 1531, Francisco Pizarro set out in search of the Incas with a tiny force of 200 men.

By contrast, in the case of the Americas, the existing populations were largely wiped out. In addition, huge numbers of people moved in, far outnumbering the number of natives that survived. Even the Mongols, who didn’t hesitate to wipe out communities in their paths, didn’t totally supplant the native populations the way the Europeans did in the Americas. Never before had an empire moved into such a vast territory that was so unpopulated (or, more accurately, depopulated). All of the other empires had to merge with, convert, or be converted by the existing populations. In the",

Below them, the crillos or creoles, were people born in the colonies to Spanish parents. Because they weren’t born in Spain, they were looked down upon by the Spanish monarchy and were consequently barred from high positions. Yet, because they were the children of Spaniards, the creoles were educated and wealthy, and after many generations, they were able to organize and demand recognition. They later became the leaders of the independence movements (more on that in the next chapter).

Shocked at the treatment of some of the natives, Christian missionaries appealed to the viceroys, emperor, and the Catholic Church to improve the natives’ lot. Some in the empire agreed that reform was needed, but disastrously, the reform that was viewed as most important was the need for more workers. They agreed to reduce the strain on the natives by bringing in new workers for the hardest jobs. Those new workers were African slaves.

The African Slave Trade: The Love of Money at the Root of Evil Even before the transatlantic voyages began, Europeans were taking slaves from Africa. In the mid- fifteenth century, the Portuguese captured slaves while exploring the coasts of Africa. When the plantations of the New World demanded more labor, the money-hungry empire builders knew where to go to get it for free. And so began a forced migration of people that would forever change the fate of millions of lives and the history of the New World. Some African rulers cooperated with the slave trade, while many protested. Regardless of cooperation, however, European traders were determined, and the slave trade increased and expanded.

From the American side, squash, beans, corn, potatoes, and cacao journeyed eastward. Of course, as previously discussed, it wasn’t just food and animals that exchanged hands, but diseases, weapons, ideas, and people. Never before had so much been moved across the oceans.

Sugarcane roots had arrived in the Caribbean from India with Columbus, who saw an opportunity to monopolize a profitable crop in a new environment. Sugarcane production resulted in the development of plantations throughout the Spanish colonies and an increased need for enslaved or forced labor once the Native populations of the islands declined. The results of the plantation system were brutal, dangerous labor and a transformation of the natural landscape.

The Commercial Revolution: The New Economy The trading, empire building, and conquest of the Age of Exploration was made possible by new financing schemes that now form the basis of our modern economies. Though many elements had to come together at once for the new economy to work, timing was on the side of the Europeans, and everything fell into place.

A substantial middle class of merchants continued to develop, which in turn attracted more investors, and the modern-day concept of a stock market was well under way. These corporations later secured royal charters for colonies, like the Jamestown colony in Virginia, and funded them for business purposes.

Under the theory of mercantilism, a country actively sought to trade, but tried not to import more than it exported; that is, it attempted to create a favorable balance of trade. Trade deficits forced dependencies on other countries, and therefore implied weakness. Of course, one country’s surplus had to be met with another country’s deficit. To resolve this dilemma, European countries were feverish to colonize. Colonies gave the mother country raw resources (not considered imports because the mother country “owned” them), while creating new markets for processed exports. To further aid the efiort, monarchies promoted domestic industry and placed tarifis on imports from competing empires.

Recall that the original Portuguese explorers were trying to figure out a short cut to India and China. Once they stumbled upon a couple of continents along the way and began wiping out native civilizations, building empires, and forcibly transporting millions of Africans to do hard labor, they forgot the original purpose of their exploration.

They also gained control over the Spice Islands by establishing naval superiority in the Straits of Malacca. In less than a century, however, other European powers coveted Asian riches. The Dutch, under the backing of the newly formed Dutch East India Company, conducted deliberate raids on Portuguese ships and trading posts. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch became the biggest power in the spice trades. Meanwhile, England and France set up trading posts in India.

DEVELOPMENTS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES AND EMPIRES 1450–1750 It’s dangerous to presume that because the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Age of Exploration eventually had enormous consequences that they did so quickly, broadly, or in equal proportions. In reality, the major movements impacted difierent parts of Europe at difierent times and took a long time to penetrate all circles of society.

Outside of Europe, the major developments of the time period also had widely varying consequences. In the previous section, we discussed the consequences on the Americas and on much of Africa. But lest you think the rest of the world remained passive in the face of European growth, it is important to note that powerful and centralized states were established (or reestablished) in the Middle East, India, China and Japan. The empires of Asia, too, had unique experiences, which are discussed in detail later in the chapter. As you review the developments in the European empires, keep in mind that most nations were led by monarchs, or sovereigns, who felt that the right to govern was ordained by God. Under this idea of divine right, it was essential for royal families to retain pure bloodlines to God, so intermarriage among royal families of",

Monarchies also contributed to the development of strong national loyalties, which led to many conicts, internally and externally.

In the beginning of this era, Spain became the world’s strongest nation with a powerful naval eet and an extensive empire. As the balance of power in Europe shifted, the rival nations of England and France emerged as great powers. A. THE EUROPEAN RIVALS 1.

Inevitably, Portugal could not maintain control of its far-ung colonies and lost control of them to the Dutch and British who had faster ships with heavier guns. The international importance of Spain grew under Charles V, who inherited a large empire. Charles was a Hapsburg, a family that originated in Austria and, through a series of carefully arranged marriages (recall that divine right promoted intermarriage among royalty), created a huge empire stretching from Austria and Germany to Spain.",

These possessions, plus the new colonies in the Americas, brought wars as well as riches. Spain fought France for control of Italy and the Ottoman Turks for control of eastern Europe, which led to an expansion of Ottoman rule into much of Hungary (more on that later).

Under Philip II, the Spanish Empire in the west saw some of its greatest expansion in the New World and a rebirth of culture under the Spanish Renaissance, but it also started showing signs of decay.

Exhibiting further signs of weakness, Spanish forces fighting for Catholicism in France fared poorly, and to the shock of many Spaniards, the English defeated and devastated the once mighty Spanish Armada as it tried to attack the British Isles. The defeat invigorated the English, who by the late sixteenth century were expanding their own empire, and signaled containment of Spanish forces.

When James I came to power in 1607 after the death of Elizabeth, a reign that brought together the crowns of England and Scotland, he attempted to institute reforms to accommodate the Catholics and the Puritans, but widespread problems persisted. The Puritans (who were Calvinists) didn’t want to recognize the power of the king over religious matters, and James reacted defensively, claiming divine right.

But Charles ignored the petition after he secured the funds he needed and, claiming divine right, ruled without calling another meeting of parliament for eleven years. In 1640, when Scotland’s resentment toward Charles resulted in a Scottish invasion of England, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session. Led by Puritans, this Parliament was known as the Long Parliament because it sat for twenty years from 1640 through 1660. The Long Parliament limited the absolute powers of the monarchy.

When Cromwell ruled as Protector, he ruled with religious intolerance and violence against Catholics and the Irish. He encouraged Protestants to settle in Northern Ireland (this would cause many problems in future centuries). All of this caused much resentment, and after Cromwell died, Parliament invited Charles II, the exiled son of the now-beheaded Charles I, to take the throne and restore a limited monarchy.

While Hobbes missed the peaceful resolution of the war in the Glorious Revolution and the English Bill of Rights (1688–1689), John Locke did not. Locke’s more optimistic view of human nature can be viewed in the context of the bloodless transition of power between James II and William and Mary.

While western Europe basked in the glow of the Renaissance, explored and expanded its inuence across oceans, and debated about religion, science, and government in a series of movements, Russia remained isolated from the west and pushed eastward instead. Its growth was territorial, but not intellectual or artistic. During the fifteenth, sixteenth, and most of the seventeenth centuries, it had nothing that could be labeled a Renaissance or Enlightenment. It wasn’t part of the Renaissance because it was under the control of the Mongols at the time. It wasn’t part of the Reformation because it wasn’t part of the Catholic Church in the first place. So even though today we often see Russia as a European power, its history progressed along a very difierent path. It wasn’t until the late seventeenth",

The situation grew especially messy from 1604 to 1613, a period that historians refer to as the Time of Troubles, because one pretender to the throne would be killed by another pretender and yet another. In 1613, the madness subsided when Michael Romanov was elected czar by the feudal lords. The Romanov Dynasty added stability to the empire. It ruled until 1917. Like the Ivans, the Romanovs consolidated power and often ruled ruthlessly. The peasants, now serfs, were practically slaves. By the late 1600s, the Romanovs had expanded the empire, with the help of the Cossacks, eastward through Siberia. By 1689, Russian territory spread from the Ukraine (west of Moscow) to the Pacific Ocean, north of Manchuria.",
    "427": "Compare Them: Forced Labor Systems Although slavery was not a new system, the demands of the newly global economy resulted in an expansion of systems of forced labor in the empires. At the same time, Russia’s attempts to control their large land mass relied on the forced labor of the peasants or serfs. All three systems took advantage of the laborers and were frequently managed by harsh and brutal overseers. In the Spanish part of the New World, haciendas were established in which Natives owed labor to their landlords—not unlike the feudalism of Europe. This system fell apart as the Native populations diminished due to disease, and as Natives converted to the Roman Catholic faith. The Portuguese took advantage of the already thriving intra-African slave trade and transformed it into a trans-oceanic one. The majority of transported Africans would up on plantations in Brazil and the Caribbean where life expectancy was just three to five years. Russian serfdom difiered in that the Russian",

He built Russia’s first navy and founded St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea as his new capital. The “window to the west,” St. Petersburg became the home to hundreds of western European engineers, scientists, architects, and artists who were recruited specifically to westernize Russia. Women of the nobility were forced to dress in western fashions. Men were forced to shave their beards. Most of the hard labor of building the great new city was accomplished, of course, by serfs turned slaves. Under Catherine the Great, who ruled from 1762 until 1796, more enlightened policies of education and western culture were implemented. Still, Russia sufiered because Catherine fiercely enforced repressive serfdom and limited the growth of the merchant class.

You might recall from the previous chapter that the territories of the former Islamic Empire were overrun by the ubiquitous Mongols in the thirteenth century. Recall also that the Byzantine Empire, centered in Constantinople, controlled most of Turkey and inuenced southeastern Europe and Russia. As the Mongol Empire fell, the Muslim Ottoman Empire, founded by Osman Bey, rose in Anatolia (eastern parts of Turkey) to unify the region and challenge the Byzantine Empire. As it grew",

As it grew in the fourteenth century, the Turks (as the Ottomans were called) came to dominate most of modern-day Turkey and eventually, in 1453, invaded Constantinople, thereby ending the Byzantine Empire. So perhaps 1450 isn’t such an artificial boundary after all. The Ottomans made Constantinople their capital city, renamed it Istanbul, and converted the great cathedrals such as the Hagia Sophia into mosques. In the expanding empire, Christians and Jews were allowed to practice their religions, making the empire one of the more tolerant of the time. Within a hundred years, the Ottomans conquered most of the regions previously held by the ancient Roman Empire, except for Italy westward. In other words, the Ottoman Empire extended from Greece eastward to Persia, and then all the way around the Mediterranean into Egypt and northern Africa. As the empire grew,",
    "434": "so too did religious persecution. To conquer large territories, the Ottomans enslaved children of their Christian subjects and turned them into fighting warriors, known as Janissaries. Much of this expansion occurred during the reign of Selim I, who came to power in 1512. Significantly, Selim claimed that he was the rightful heir to Islamic tradition under the Arab caliphs. With that claim, and with such a huge empire, Istanbul became the center of Islamic civilization. Just eight years later, Suleiman I (a.k.a. Suleiman the Magnificent) rose to power. He not only built up the Ottoman military, but also actively encouraged the development of the arts. For this reason, the Ottoman Empire experienced a golden age under his reign, which lasted from 1520 until 1566. During this time, the Ottomans tried to push into Europe through Hungary. You already read that the Holy Roman Empire was weakening during the Protestant Reformation. The Ottomans took advantage of this weakness; after taking",

From Vienna, the Turks could have easily poured into the unstable lands of the Holy Roman Empire. But it wasn’t meant to be. Vienna was as far as the Turks ever got. Although Austrian princes and the Ottomans battled continually for the next century, the Ottomans were never able to expand much beyond the European territories of Byzantine influence. Still, the Ottoman Empire lasted until 1922, making it one of the world’s most significant empires. In that time, it greatly expanded the reach of Islam, while also keeping eastern Europe in a constant state of ux. This allowed the powers of western Europe to dominate, and once they started exploring the oceans, they were able to circumvent their eastern neighbors and trade directly with India, China, and",

This centralized state was based on military conquest and dominated by Shia Islam. Its location between the Ottomans and the Mughals, in what is modern-day Iran, resulted in often contentious relationships between the Muslim states, alliances with European against the Ottomans, and a continuation of the long- standing rift between the Sunni and Shia sects. Remember the Mongols? In 1526, Babur, a leader who claimed to be descended from Genghis Khan but was very much Muslim, invaded northern India and quickly defeated the Delhi Sultanate (also Muslim). Babur quickly established a new empire, known as the Mughal Empire, which dominated the Indian subcontinent for the next 300 years. The Mughal Empire was distinctive for several reasons. First, within about 150 years, it had united almost the entire subcontinent, something that hadn’t previously been done to the same",

The Deccan Plateau in southern India had remained mostly isolated. It was there that Hinduism became very firmly established. Babur’s grandson, Akbar, who ruled from 1556 to 1605, was able to unify much of India by governing under a policy of religious toleration. He allowed Hinduism and Islam to be practiced openly. He eliminated the jizya, the head tax on Hindus that had been a source of great anger to the people, and tried to improve the position of women by attempting to eliminate sati, the practice in which high-caste Hindu women would throw themselves onto their husbands’ funeral pyres. He even married a Hindu woman, and welcomed Hindus into government positions. For nearly 100 years, Hindus and Muslims increasingly lived side-by-side and, consequently, became more geographically mixed. The result was a golden",

The first was that religious toleration ended. The Muslim government reinstated the jizya; Hindu temples were destroyed. The consequences of this development were significant for later centuries, but for the moment, understand that by 1700, Muslims began to persecute Hindus and Hindus were organizing against their Muslim rulers and neighbors. The second development was the arrival of the Europeans. In the early seventeenth century, the Portuguese and British were fighting each other for Indian Ocean trade routes. In the beginning, Portugal had established trade with the city of Goa, where it also sent Christian missionaries. By 1661, the British East India Company had substantial control of trade in Bombay. By 1691, the British dominated trade in the region and founded the city of Calcutta as a trading outpost. While the",
    "439": "Mughal emperors were annoyed with the Europeans, they generally permitted the trade and regarded the Europeans as relatively harmless. Of course, the Industrial Revolution would turn Britain into an imperial superpower. But before 1750—the calm before the storm—India didn’t feel particularly vulnerable to the Europeans, except in its port cities. It was a huge country with tons of resources united under strong Muslim rulers. It couldn’t be conquered, right? At the time, Indians probably couldn’t imagine that a century later, a British woman named Victoria would be crowned Empress of India. D. AFRICA Beginning in the tenth century, strong centralized states developed in southern and western Africa based on the wealth accumulated from trade. The trend of increased power continued with the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the establishment of powerful kingdoms by the Songhai, and in the kingdoms of Kongo and Angola, among others. While you are not expected to know each of these kingdoms in",
    "440": "detail, you should recognize the pattern of state-building and the relationship of Africa to both the Islamic world and the Europeans. The sub-Saharan empire of Songhai was mentioned briey in the previous chapter. Like its predecessors, Ghana and Mali, this was an Islamic state with economic ties to the Muslim world through the trans-Saharan trade of salt and gold. Like other empires, this was built on conquests and military force. Sunni Ali (ruled 1464–1493) consolidated his empire in the valley of the Niger River using an imperial navy, established a central administration, and financed the city of Timbuktu as a major Islamic center. And like all great empires, Songhai fell, in this case to Moroccans with muskets, a superior military force. On the west coast of Africa, the centralized kingdom of Kongo was bolstered by its trade with Portuguese merchants as early as the 1480s. The Europeans established close economic and political relationships with the king, which initially worked to",
    "441": "everyone’s advantage. The kings of the Kongo converted to Roman Catholicism, and King Alfonso I was particularly successful at converting his people.

Eventually, there were outright hostilities and war between the two former allies and the kingdom was mostly destroyed. South of Kongo, the Portuguese established a small trading post in Ndongo, or Angola, as early as 1575 for the sole purpose of expanding their trade in slaves from the interior. As a result, Angola grew into a powerful state and when the Portuguese attempted to further exert their authority and control, Queen Nzinga fiercely resisted. For 40 years, the warrior queen led her troops in battle, studied European military tactics, and made alliances with Portugal’s Dutch rivals. Despite her efiorts, in the end, she could not unify her rivals nor overcome the superior weaponry of the Portuguese. E. ISOLATED ASIA 1. China By 1368, the Ming Dynasty booted out the last of the Mongol rulers in China and restored power over the",
    "443": "empire to the native Chinese. The Ming Dynasty ruled until 1644. During this time, the Ming built a strong centralized government based on traditional Confucian principles, reinstated the civil service examination, and removed the Mongol influence by reinvigorating Chinese culture. In the early fifteenth century, the Chinese also did something quite extraordinary: They built huge fleets. Zheng He, a Chinese navigator, led eets throughout southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, all the way to East Africa, a century before the Europeans did the same. Had the Chinese continued to explore and trade, they may have become the dominant colonial power. But instead, within a few decades, the Chinese abruptly stopped their naval voyages. Increasingly, Chinese society turned inward. The Ming government attempted to prop up their failing economy by changing easily counterfeited paper money to a “single-whip” system based on silver currency. Initially, Japan supplied the silver (much to the benefit of",
    "444": "the shoguns in Japan), but with the discovery of American silver sources, China established trade relations with the Spanish through the Philippines. Although this exchange fueled a period of commercial expansion, inevitably, the silver flooded the Chinese market and the government was unable to control the resulting inflation. By the sixteenth century, the Ming dynasty was already in its decline, just as the Europeans were beginning to sail toward China. Pirates increasingly raided port cities, and the Portuguese set up shop in Macao. Still, the Chinese were able to keep the Europeans at a safe distance. However, internal problems persisted. By the seventeenth century, famines crippled the Chinese economy, and peasant revolts erupted against the increasingly powerless Ming rulers. In 1644, the Ming emperor invited a group of Qing warriors from nearby Manchuria to help him quell a peasant uprising, but instead, the Qing ousted the emperor.

There crops along with new agricultural technologies, and political stability were initially a boon to China’s economy and productivity. However, the new population levels could not be sustained over the long term, and a period of global cooling in the late seventeenth century put pressure on agricultural lands and hastened the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. In Europe, the arrival of potatoes finally stabilized a food supply and a population that had been devastated by centuries of cold weather, poor farming, and epidemic disease.",
    "447": "Because the Qing were from Manchuria, they were not ethnically Chinese. They attempted to remain an ethnic elite, forbidding the Chinese to learn the Manchu language or to marry Manchus. Yet, because the Manchus comprised a mere 3 percent of the population, they needed the help of ethnic Chinese to run the country. Therefore, the civil service examination gained new heights. Even members of the lower classes were able to rise to positions of responsibility as the Manchus opened up the floodgates to find the best talent. Manchu emperors were well steeped in Chinese traditions. Kangxi, who ruled from 1662 to 1722, was a Confucian scholar. His chief successor, Qianlong, who ruled from 1735 to 1795, was as well. Both emperors not only supported the arts, but also expanded the empire. Kangxi conquered Taiwan and extended the empire into Mongolia, central Asia, and Tibet. Qianlong added Vietnam, Burma, and Nepal to the vassal states of China. In all of this expansion, the Chinese did not",
    "448": "aspire to conquer the rest of the world, or even interact with it very much. They stayed focused on China and its surrounding neighbors. The Manchus did trade with the Europeans, and granted rights to the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, but they were vigilant about and successful at controlling trade relations through the mid-eighteenth century. The Manchu were fierce protectors of their culture. When they felt threatened by European advances, they expelled them. In 1724, for example, Christianity was banned. In 1757, trade was restricted to just one city, Canton. Still, trade with Europeans was substantial. The Europeans bought large quantities of tea, silk, and porcelain. In exchange, the merchants received huge sums of silver, which created a new rising class of merchants in Chinese coastal cities. 2. Japan During the sixteenth century in Japan, a series of shoguns continued to rule while the emperor remained merely as a figurehead. But as the century went on, Japanese feudalism",
    "449": "began to wane and centralized power began to emerge. The shogun still ruled (as opposed to the emperor), but the power of the feudal lords was reduced. This coincided with Japanese exposure to the West. In 1542, the Portuguese established trade with the empire (they also introduced guns to the Japanese). Within a decade, Christian missionaries streamed in. By the end of the century, not only had a few hundred thousand Japanese converted to Christianity, but the Jesuits took control of the port city of Nagasaki and trade flourished. Japan was well on its way to westernization. In 1600, the trend changed dramatically. In that year, Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa Shogunate, a strict and rigid government that ruled Japan until 1868. The shogun further consolidated power away from the emperor and at the expense of the daimyo (feudal lords). Ieyasu claimed personal ownership to all lands within Japan and instituted a rigid social class model, inspired somewhat by Confucianism but",
    "450": "in practice more like the caste system. Four classes (warrior, farmer, artisan, and merchant) were established and movement among the classes was forbidden.

Within two decades, Christians were persecuted. By 1635, a National Seclusion Policy",
    "451": "a reversal in attitudes toward Western inuences. Within two decades, Christians were persecuted. By 1635, a National Seclusion Policy prohibited Japanese from traveling abroad, and prohibited most foreigners from visiting Japan (limited relations were kept with China, Korea, and the Netherlands). In other words, Japan became increasingly secluded. The policy remained in place for nearly 200 years. Tokugawa was very serious about this policy. He was worried that Japan would be overrun by foreign inuences. Keep in mind that Spain had claimed the nearby Philippines and that the English and Portuguese kept trying to make their way into China. So, in 1640, when a group of Portuguese diplomats and traders sailed to Japan to try to negotiate with the emperor and convince him to open up a dialogue, the shogun had every member of the Portuguese delegation executed on the spot. The message was clear. Japan was off limits. The absence of foreign inuences allowed Japanese culture to thrive. During",
    "452": "this time period, Buddhism and Shinto remained at the center of culture, and unique Japanese art forms also prospered. Kabuki theatre and a new form of poetry, haiku, became very popular. Artists gave their lives to the creation of richly detailed scrolls, wood-block prints and paintings. In other words, under a strong central authority, Japanese culture underwent its own renaissance. Unlike the European Renaissance, however, it was strictly intended for domestic consumption.",
    "453": "Contrast Them: India, China, and Japan on European Aggression No doubt about it, the Japanese under the Tokugawa Shogunate reacted most decisively against European colonialism. China and India both allowed trade and European occupation of port cities, although China increasingly limited it under the Manchus. India was the least suspecting of the Europeans, and it paid dearly. In the next chapter you’ll see the consequences of these three attitudes toward the Europeans: India was overrun, China was partially overrun, and Japan, after briey falling prey to outside inuence, turned the tables and became a colonizing empire itself.",
    "454": "V. TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS 1450–1750 Europe became a powerful force during this time period because of their willingness to adapt and use three key innovations that existed in other parts of the world: gunpowder weapons, navigation and ship-building technology, and finally the printing press (which developed independently in Germany). But at a time when competition among the Europeans resulted in big risks and innovations, the Chinese and Japanese returned to more traditional lifestyles in order to maintain stability, and the Muslims, while retaining powerful land-based empires, allowed innovations in shipping and weaponry to pass them by. The biggest impact of these new technologies was the expanded knowledge of the world that resulted from exploration by the European nations. Using their superior weapons and larger trading ships, the Europeans established new overseas trading empires, moved lots of plants and animals, enslaved and transported people across oceans, and generally",
    "455": "transformed the interactions of the entire world. They fought wars with one another in Europe and—when they were unable to establish suitable trading relationships—went to war in the places they wished to conquer. Increased contact meant the spread of new ideas and technology (such as the printing press), and the exposure to new cultures transformed both education and religion. The establishment of new Protestant churches in northern Europe increased the power of the kings and nation- states at the expense of the Catholic Church. Conversely, religious conicts led to increased migrations from northern Europe and the resettlement of large numbers of colonists in the New World. VI. CHANGES AND CONTINUITIES IN THE ROLE OF WOMEN A number of powerful women took charge of the most powerful empires of this time. These included Elizabeth I of England, Isabella of Spain, and Nur Jahan of Mughal, India. With the exception of the English queen, most of these women shared power with their husbands.",
    "456": "And in spite of the great power and visibility of these few elite women, for the most part, the status and freedoms of women changed little from the previous period—legally they were often considered property of their husbands, inherited less than sons or brothers, and had few rights in legal or political spheres. The biggest change in the lives of women came from the mixing of previously unknown cultures. The result of global exploration and colonization, these new relationships produced ofispring considered mixed or mestizo. Racial categories began to be more widely used in determining status or class hierarchy, and restrictions developed regarding marriages and legal relationships between classes. Changes in trade and production also placed a greater premium on male labor and jobs that women had traditionally held, like textile weaving, were increasing dominated by men. Some regions of the world served as exceptions to these general patterns, but were still impacted by the global",
    "457": "interactions. The forced migration of males in African societies resulted in a disproportionate number of females left behind in what were already matrilineal societies. These numbers reinforced polygyny or multiple marriages. Although large numbers of men also migrated from Europe, the predominately Christian societies did not allow multiple marriages, and as the number of unmarried women increased this created a problem in societies that regarded marriage as the goal of all women. The non-European areas of the world tended to regard older or widowed women with both respect and superstition. In both Africa and many Native American societies, councils of older women were part of the political decision making process. However, older women were also to be feared as they couldn’t necessarily be controlled. It was this need for control that led to a continuation of Neo-Confucianism values in eastern Asia. This social philosophy designated proper roles and virtues for women within the home",
    "458": "with the understanding that if the home were stable so was the state. In Europe, the revolutionary new ideas of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment included women at least nominally. Education was more widely available to all classes, but opportunities for girls lagged far behind those of boys, and the highest levels of education were only open to males. Even the less-hierarchical new Protestant religions limited the roles of women to wife and mother and did not have convents or monastic systems as alternatives to traditional roles. Eventually, the Protestant countries grew even more puritanical in their regulation of sex, marriage, and illegitimacy. VII. PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER",
    "459": "VII. PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER In the context of the Age of Exploration, “exploration” has lots of connotations. Of course, the most obvious is that it involved European exploration of the Americas, and the beginnings of direct contact with Asia. But more than that, its exploration was also internal. In the Renaissance, Europe explored its own lost history. During the Protestant Reformation it explored its relationship with God. During the Scientific Revolution Europe explored the universe and the laws by which the universe functioned. During the Enlightenment it explored the rights of man and the appropriate role of government, even as its empire depended on slavery. And during the Commercial Revolution, Europe explored its potential. Combined, these explorations were going in all directions—outward, upward, inward, backward to the past, forward to the future—and it was all going on simultaneously. If you’re confused by the developments, you should be. It’s hard to figure out which",
    "460": "movements in which combination impacted which events. Historians haven’t sorted it out either. It’s open to debate. What we can say is this: During the time period discussed in the chapter, Europe was where the energy was. There was so much change, for so many reasons, that the boundaries of the continent literally couldn’t contain it. Unlike China and Japan, which largely looked inward, and unlike the Islamic world, which didn’t take to the seas or radically shake up religious and social orders, Europeans were dynamic at this particular time in history. They were analyzing everything and they were full of inconsistencies. Other civilizations at other times in history had at least as much energy and unrest, but because the Europeans had the technology, the political motivation, and the financial structure, they were able to quickly explode onto the world scene. Add in the evangelical nature of Christianity (an explicit desire to convert the world) and it’s clear that the desire for",
    "461": "expansion ran deep. Some would say that European monarchs ruled absolutely during this time period and adopted a controlling, ethnocentric attitude with regard to the cultures they dominated. Perhaps this was precisely because Europe was in such cultural chaos itself. Who knows? We’ll leave that to your further studies. In any case, it’s hard to deny that even as Europeans explored their own history, culture, and structures to unprecedented degrees, they had little trouble marginalizing the complexities of others. WHAT ABOUT THE NON–EUROPEAN CULTURES? WHY WAS THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE WEST SO VARIED? There are lots of ways to answer these questions, but we’ll get you started. China and Japan were both highly organized, confident civilizations. The contingencies of Europeans on their shores were modest. Because the Japanese and Chinese wanted desperately to preserve their own cultures, and because they had the power and sophistication to keep the Europeans, for the moment, at bay,",
    "462": "that’s precisely what they did. Why didn’t the others? In Africa, the societies were fragmented. No centralized power existed, so the Europeans were harder to fend ofi. What’s more, the Europeans weren’t initially obsessed with penetrating the entire continent. Because they didn’t have to overtake entire civilizations to achieve their goals, they were able to trade goods and abduct individuals one by one, with little concern for long-term impact on the continent. In the Americas, of course, civilizations were quickly overwhelmed by European technology and disease. And in the Ottoman Empire and Arabia, the interaction was somewhat limited because the Europeans weren’t as dependent on the overland routes in their efiorts to trade with India and China. This diminished the importance of the Middle East to the Europeans. What’s more, because the Crusades ended unsuccessfully for the Europeans, trade with the Muslims was important but conquest of the region was off the radar. FINALLY, WHAT",
    "463": "ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY? HOW DID IT CHANGE? In short, sailing, mercantilism, and private investment changed the global economy. In a few more words: Improvements in sailing diminished the need for the Asian land routes and connected the world like never before. Mercantilism and its dependence on the establishment of imperialism married economic and political developments. And the establishment of joint-stock companies took major economic motivation out of the hands of governments and put it into the hands of the private sector. This meant that now thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of people had a direct stake in trade routes and conquest. Because the benefits of economic prosperity were difiused among a larger group of individuals than ever before, governments began to lose their grip on controlling their own economies.

Keep in mind the political and economic decisions that resulted in environmental change. At the same time, the environment impacted people.

INDUSTRY AND IMPERIALISM The Industrial Revolution, which began in the mid-eighteenth century in Britain and spread rapidly through the nineteenth century, is inseparable from the Age of Imperialism, which reached its peak in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Industrial technology had two enormous consequences: (1) Countries with industrial technology by denition had advanced military weapons and capacity, and were therefore easily able to conquer people who did not have this technology; (2) To succeed, factories needed access to raw materials to make finished products, and then markets to sell those finished products. Colonies fit both of these roles quite well. Because the bulk of the western hemisphere freed itself from European control by the early nineteenth century (a lot more on this later),",

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION The Industrial Revolution began in Britain, helping to propel the country to its undisputed ranking as the most powerful in the nineteenth century. But Britain wasn’t the only country that industrialized. The revolution spread through much of Europe, especially Belgium, France, and Germany, as well as to Japan and ultimately to the country that would eclipse Britain as the most industrialized—the United States. Still, since most of the developments occurred in Britain rst, and since the social consequences that occurred in Britain are representative of those that occurred elsewhere, this section will focus heavily on the revolution in Britain. References to other countries will be made where warranted. Agricultural Revolution Part II Hopefully you remember that early civilizations came about, in part, because of an Agricultural Revolution",

In the eighteenth century, agricultural output increased dramatically once again. This time, it allowed not just some people, but as much as half of the population to leave the farms and head toward the cities, where jobs in the new industrial economy were becoming available. Keep in mind that agricultural techniques had been slowly improving throughout history. Since so many developments happened so quickly in the eighteenth century this period was considered a revolution. Agricultural output increased for a whole host of reasons. Potatoes, corn, and other high-yield crops were introduced to Europe from the colonies in the New World. Farmers started rotating their crops, rather than leaving one-third of their land fallow (as they had done in the Middle Ages under the three-eld system), which allowed them to farm all of their land",

Through a process known simply as enclosure, public lands that were shared during the Middle Ages were enclosed by fences, which allowed for private farming and private gain. But what really cranked up the eciency and productivity of the farms was the introduction of new technologies. New machines for plowing, seeding, and reaping, along with the development of chemical fertilizers, allowed farmers to greatly increase the amount of land they could farm, while decreasing the number of people needed to do it. Urbanization was a natural outgrowth of the increased eciencies in farming and agriculture. In short, cities grew. In 1800, there were only 20 cities in Europe with a population of more than 100,000. By 1900, 150 cities had similar populations, and the largest, London, had a population of more than 6 million. Cities developed in areas where resources such as coal, iron, water, and railroads were available for manufacturing.",
    "479": "The more factories that developed in favorable locations, the larger cities would grow. In 1800, along with London, the Chinese cities of Beijing (Peking) and Canton ranked in the top three, but just 100 years later, nine of the ten largest cities in the world were in Europe or the United States.",
    "480": "Technological Innovations: The Little Engine That Could Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most Europeans worked on farms, at home, or in small shops. Even after Britain started importing huge amounts of cotton from its American colonies, most of the cotton was woven into cloth in homes or small shops as part of an inecient, highly labor-intensive arrangement known as the domestic system. Middlemen would drop of wool or cotton at homes where women would make cloth, which would then be picked up again by the middlemen, who would sell the cloth to buyers. All of this was done one person at a time. However, a series of technological advancements in the eighteenth century changed all this. In 1733, John Kay invented the ying shuttle, which sped up the weaving process. In 1764, John Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which was capable of spinning vast amounts of thread. When waterpower was added to these processes, notably by Richard Arkwright and Edward Cartright in the late",

In 1793, when Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, thereby allowing massive amounts of cotton to be quickly processed in the Americas and exported to Europe, the textile industry was taken out of the homes and into the mills entirely. Although industrialization hit the textile industry rst, it spread well beyond into other industries. One of the most signicant developments was the invention of the steam engine, which actually took the work of several people to perfect. In the early 1700s, Thomas Newcomer developed an inecient engine, but in 1769, James Watt dramatically improved it. The steam engine was revolutionary because steam could not only be used to generate power for industry but also for transportation. In 1807, Robert Fulton built the rst steamship, and",

Because Britain had vast amounts of coal, and because the steam engine was powered by coal, Britain industrialized very quickly.

Later, Henry Ford’s use of the assembly line meant that each factory worker added only one part to a nished product, one after another after another. These were incredibly important developments in manufacturing, and they made the factory system wildly protable, but they came with social costs.

Whereas the farms exposed people to fresh air and sunshine, the factories exposed workers to air pollution and hazardous machinery. The farms provided seasonal adjustments to the work pattern, while the factories spit out the same products day after day, all year long. The despair and hopelessness of the daily lives of the factory workers were captured by many novelists and social commentators of the time (for example, Charles Dickens).",

In many ways, this lessened the restrictions on young women and men. They were able to live away from home, manage their own incomes, and pursue independent leisure activities—theatres, dance halls, recitals, dining out in restaurants—all of which developed to support the new urban working class.

Because of urbanization, people were living side by side. They could see the huge diferences among the classes right before their eyes. What’s more, the members of the working class saw factory owners gain wealth quickly—at their expense. The owners didn’t inherit their position, but instead achieved success by exploiting their workers, and the workers knew it. In the past, under feudalism, people more readily accepted their position because, as far as they knew, the social structure was the way it had always been, and that’s the way it was meant to be. If your dad was a farmer, you were a farmer. If your dad was the king, you were a prince. After industrialism, people literally saw for the first time the connection between their sacrifices and the aristocracy’s luxuries.",
    "492": "The rise of the industrial class had its origins in the concept of private ownership. Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations (1776) that economic prosperity and fairness is best achieved through private ownership. Individuals should own the means of production and sell their products and services in a free and open market, where the demand for their goods and services would determine their prices and availability. A free market system (also known as capitalism), Smith argued, would best meet the needs and desires of individuals and nations as a whole. When governments remove themselves entirely from regulation, the process is called laissez-faire capitalism. Smith wrote his book in response to the western European mercantilist practices that had dominated during the Age of Exploration. In the New World, monarchies—which were not only corrupt, but also highly inecient—closely managed their economies. In the nineteenth century, European countries continued to develop their",

While Adam Smith believed that free market capitalism would lead to better opportunities for everyone, Karl Marx, a German economist and philosopher who spent a good part of his adult life living in poverty, pointed out that the factory workers had genuine opportunities but were being exploited as a consequence of capitalism. In other words, the abuses weren’t merely the result of the way in which capitalism was practiced, but an inherent aw in the system.

Marx and Engels were not just theorizing, they were also observing, and there was much discontent to support their view. In England in the early 1800s, groups of workers known as Luddites destroyed equipment in factories in the middle of the night to protest working conditions and pitiful wages. The government unequivocally sided with the business owners, executing some of the workers, while also enacting harsh laws against any further action.

There, Marxist ideas grew popular among a small group of urban intellectuals, eventually including Vladimir Lenin, who believed they could lead a worker revolution and end the tyranny of the czars. Elsewhere, Marxism impacted social thought and intermixed with capitalist thought to create economic systems that were partly socialist (in which the government owned some of the means of production) and partly capitalist (in which individuals owned some of the means of production).

Meanwhile, labor unions were formed. The unions were vehicles through which thousands of employees bargained for better working conditions, or threatened to strike, thereby shutting down the factory. In addition, an increasing number of factory owners realized that a healthy, happy, and reasonably well-paid workforce meant a productive and loyal one. All of these developments combined, though slowly and sporadically, to improve not only the conditions in the factories and cities, but also the standard of living on an individual family level.

In 1833, the British outlawed slavery, and three decades later, it was outlawed in the United States. As men earned more money, women left the factories and returned to their traditional roles in the home, which limited their inuence socially, politically, professionally, and intellectually, even as democratic reforms greatly increased the power of most men, especially through the right to vote. In response, women began organizing to increase their collective inuence.

Millions fled from famine in Ireland, or anti-Semitism in Russia, or poverty and joblessness in general. In Search of Natural Resources: Stealing Is Cheaper than Dealing The factories of the Industrial Revolution created useful products, but to do so they required natural resources. Europe had its share of coal and iron ore used to provide power and make equipment for the factories, but raw materials such as cotton and rubber had to be imported because they didn’t grow in the climates of western Europe.

Europe became a clearinghouse for raw materials from around the globe while the rest of the world increasingly became exposed to Europe and European ideas. What’s more, the need for raw materials transformed the landscape of the conquered regions. Limited raw materials depleted faster than at any time in human history.

Two ideas contributed to this mindset. First, social Darwinists applied Charles Darwin’s biological theory of natural selection to sociology. In other words, they claimed that dominant races or classes of people rose to the top through a process of “survival of the ttest.” This meant that because Britain was the most powerful, it was the most fit, and therefore the British were superior to other races.

Overwhelmed by British military might, China was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing, the rst of what came to be known as the “unequal treaties,” by which Britain was given considerable rights to expand trade with China. And, of course, the right to create more opium addicts. In 1843, Britain declared Hong Kong its own crown possession, a signicant development because that went beyond trading rights and actually established a British colony in the region.

Adopting guerilla warfare tactics, the Boxers slaughtered Christian missionaries and seized control of foreign embassies. Ultimately, however, they were not successful in achieving their aims. Instead, their uprising resulted in the dispatch of foreign reinforcements who quickly and decisively put down the rebellion. The Manchu government, already having made great concessions to the Europeans and Japanese, was then even further humiliated.

In China, Europeans and the Japanese established spheres of inuence, focusing on the economic benets of trade with no overall governmental responsibilities.

JAPANESE IMPERIALISM During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Japan succeeded in keeping European inuences away from its shores. It consequently built a highly ethnocentric, self-involved society that didn’t even allow its own citizens to travel abroad.

As in China, the nationalists grew resentful, but unlike the Chinese, the Japanese were organized. Through the leadership of the samurai, they revolted against the shogun who had ratied these treaties, and restored Emperor Meiji to power. The Meiji Restoration: Shogun Out, Emperor In, Westerners Out The Meiji Restoration ushered in an era of Japanese westernization, after which Japan emerged as a world power.

In the 1890s, Japanese industrial and military power really started to roll. It was now powerful enough to substantially reduce European and U.S. inuence. It maintained trade, but on equal footing with western powers. Japan went through an incredibly quick Industrial Revolution. In 1895, Japan defeated China in a war for control of Korea and Taiwan.

Still, the pattern was remarkably similar. Private corporations rose up, industrialists like the Mitsubishi family became wealthy, factories were built, urbanization increased dramatically, and reform was instituted. Japan learned from the Europeans quite well. If you can’t beat an industrialized power, become one yourself.",

To be sure, north of the Sahara, in Egypt and along the Mediterranean, Europeans had historical interest and impact. But the vast interior of the continent remained unknown to the outside world. During the Age of Exploration, coastal regions of Africa became important to Europeans for limited trade, and also for strategic positioning, as stopping-of points for merchant ships en route to India or China. Most signicantly, of course, Africa became the center of the slave trade. The Slave Trade Finally Ends As Enlightenment principles took root in Europe, larger and larger numbers of people grew outraged at the idea of slavery. Between 1807 and 1820, most European nations abolished the slave trade, although slavery itself was not abolished until a few decades later. In other words, no new slaves were legally imported",

Of course, throughout this entire process, Africans were not allowed claims to the gold and diamonds, and were made to work in the mines as their natural resources were sent abroad. South Africa became a signicant British colony, complete with extensive investment in infrastructure and institutions. In 1910, the colony had its own constitution, and it became the Union of South Africa, still part of the British Commonwealth, but exercising a considerable amount of self-rule.

When Napoleon tried to conquer Egypt during his tireless attempt to expand France into a mega-empire at the turn of the nineteenth century, Muhammad Ali defeated the French and the Ottomans, and gained control of Egypt in 1805.

Because Britain had a huge colony in India, the canal became more important to the British than to anyone else. As Egypt’s nances went into a tailspin because of excessive government spending, Egypt started selling stock in its canal to raise money, stock that the British government eagerly gobbled up.

With rules in hand, the Europeans left the conference in haste. Each country wanted to be the rst to establish possession in the various parts of Africa.

Because the Berlin Conference of 1884 encouraged colonialism solely based on bargaining for political and economic advantage, the boundary lines that eventually separated colonial territories were based on European concerns, not on African history or culture.

Except for the colonies controlled by the British, the African colonies were governed by direct rule, similar to European rule of colonies in the Americas. This meant they sent European ocials to occupy all positions of authority. Native traditions were overcome, not tolerated, and certainly not developed.

The American Revolution For the most part, you won’t need to know much about American history for the AP World History Exam.

As you know, Britain began colonizing the east coast of North America during the seventeenth century. By the mid-eighteenth century, British colonists in America felt threatened by France’s colonial settlements on the continent. France and Britain were long-time rivals (archenemies in the Hundred Years’ War and since) and they carried this rivalry with them into ghts in America.

While the colonists were thrilled with the results of the war, the British were upset about the costs, and felt that the American colonists did not adequately share in the burden. Of course, the colonists resented this, claiming that it was their eforts that made colonial expansion possible in the first place. At the same time, Britain’s George Grenville and later Charles Townshend passed very unpopular laws on behalf of the British crown. These laws, including the Revenue Act (1764), the Stamp Act (1765), and the Tea Act (1773), were intended to raise additional funds for the British crown. In addition to generating funds, however, these laws generated unrest, not only because American colonists thought they were economically unfair but also",

The War of Independence had begun. Independence Can’t Happen Without a Little Paine The overwhelming majority of American colonists had either been born in England or were children of those born in England, and therefore many colonists felt ambivalent about—if not completely opposed to—the movement for independence.

With droughts damaging the French harvests and the nobility scong at spending restrictions, Louis XVI needed to raise taxes, but to do that he needed to get everyone on board. So, in 1789, he called a meeting of the Estates General, a “governing body” that hadn’t met in some 175 years. Bourbon monarchs, you’ll recall, ruled under divine right, so no other input was generally seen as necessary.

When Louis XVI summoned the Estates General, he was in essence summoning representatives from each of these three estates. The representative nobles of the Second Estate came to the meeting of the Estates General hoping to gain favors from the king in the form of political power and greater freedoms in the form of a new constitution.

The king got nervous, and forced the other two estates to join them in an efort to write a new constitution. But it was too little, too late. By then, peasants throughout the land were growing restless and were concerned that the king wasn’t going to follow through on the major reforms they wanted.

Meanwhile, the king and his family were taken to Paris, where the Third Estate revolutionaries could ensure that they wouldn’t interfere with the work of the National Assembly.

Domestically, Napoleon initiated many reforms in agriculture, infrastructure, and public education. He also normalized relations with the church and restored a degree of tolerance and stability.

In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo, a Creole priest who sympathized with those who had been abused under Spanish colonialism, led a revolt against Spanish rule. Unlike in South America, however, the Spanish armies resisted efectively, and they put down the revolt at Calderon Bridge, where Hidalgo was executed. Hidalgo’s eforts were not in vain, however, because they put the revolution in motion. Jose Morelos picked up where Hidalgo left of and led the revolutionaries to further successes against the loyalists. But similar to what later happened in Brazil, the land-owning class turned against him when he made clear his intentions to redistribute land to the poor. In 1815, he was executed. It wasn’t until 1821, after the landowning class bought into the idea of separation from Spain, that independence was nally",

The Effects of the Independence Movements: More Independence than Freedom While Europe was efectively booted out of many parts of the American continents during a 50-year time span beginning in about 1780, in some Latin American countries the independence from colonial power wasn’t accompanied by widespread freedom among the vast majority of citizens. As in the United States, slavery still existed for decades. Peasants still worked on huge plantations owned by a few landowners. But unlike in the United States, a signicant middle class of merchants and small farmers didn’t emerge, and many of the Enlightenment ideas didn’t spread to populations other than the land-owning male class. There were several reasons for this. The Catholic Church remained very powerful in Latin America,",

The church, after all, was one of the largest landowners in Latin America. What’s more, the economies of Latin America, while free of Europe, were still largely dependent on Europe. Latin American countries still participated in European mercantilism, often to their own detriment. They specialized in a few cash crops, exported almost exclusively to Europe, and then bought back nished products. In other words, most Latin American economies didn’t diversify, nor did they broaden opportunities to a larger class of people, so innovation and creativity rarely took root. There are notable exceptions. Chile diversied its economy fairly successfully, and Brazil and Argentina instituted social reform and broadened their economies to include a growing middle class.

TWO UNIFICATIONS: ITALY AND GERMANY One of the consequences of the Napoleonic era was that it intensied nationalism, or feelings of connection to one’s own home, region, language, and culture. France, Spain, Portugal, Britain, and Russia, of course, had already unied and, in some cases, built enormous empires. But the Italian and German city-states were still very feudal, and were constantly at the center of warfare among the European powers. In the second half of the nineteenth century, however, all of that changed. Italy and Germany unied, and with unication, they eventually altered the balance of European power. The Unification of Italy: Italians Give Foreign Occupiers the Boot",

France controlled Rome and the Papal States in the mid-section. And Spain controlled the Kingdoms of Two Sicilies (which included Sicily and the “foot” of Italy including Naples) in the south. Only the divided kingdom of Sardinia (part of which was an island in the Mediterranean) was controlled by Italians. In 1849, the king of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel II, named Count Camillo Cavour his prime minister, and nationalism in Italy took of. Both Emmanuel and Cavour believed strongly in Italian unication. Through a series of wars in which Cavour sided with European powers that could help him boot out Austria from Italy, he managed to remove Austrian inuence from all parts of Italy (except Venetia) by 1859. Meanwhile, Giuseppe Garibaldi, another Italian nationalist, raised a volunteer army and in 1860 drove Spain from the Kingdom of Two",

In the following decade, the Italians managed to gain control of Venetia after siding with Prussia in its war against Austria (which previously controlled Venetia) and nally won control of Rome in 1870 when the French withdrew. Still, even though Italy was essentially unied, the boundaries of Europe were still very shaky. Some Italians thought that southern provinces of Austria and France were far more Italian than not and that those provinces were rightly part of Italy. What’s more, Italy had a hard time unifying culturally because for centuries it had developed more regionally. Still, now unied, Italy was more able to assert itself on the world stage, a development that would impact Europe in the next century.

They also strongly supported education, which created a talented work force. Many in Prussia wanted to consolidate the German territories into a powerful empire to rival the great powers of Europe, particularly Britain, France, and increasingly Russia. So, in 1861, the new king of Prussia, William I, appointed Otto von Bismarck prime minister with the aim of building the military and consolidating the region under its authority. In order to achieve this consolidation, Bismarck had to defeat Austria, which he did in only seven weeks, after he won assurances from the",

Through further war and annexation, Bismarck secured most of the other German principalities, except for heavily Catholic regions in the south.

In 1871, the victorious Bismarck crowned King William I as emperor of the new German Empire, which was also known as the Second Reich (“second empire,” after the Holy Roman Empire, which was known as the First Reich). After unication, Germany quickly industrialized and became a strong economic and political power. But Otto was not popular with everyone, especially socialists.

It did little good. The serfs were given very small plots of land for which they had to give huge payments to the government to keep, so it was dicult for them to improve their lot. Some peasants headed to the cities to work in Russia’s burgeoning industries, but there, too, the reforms that softened some of the harsher working conditions in the West hadn’t made their way eastward.

Meanwhile, an intellectual class well-acquainted with political and economic thought in the rest of Europe began to assert itself against the monarchy. In 1881, Alexander II was assassinated by a political group known as The People’s Will. Alexander III reacted ercely by attempting to suppress anything that he perceived as anti-Russian.

On a Sunday in 1905, moderates marched on the czar’s palace in a peaceful protest, an attempt to encourage him to enact Enlightened reforms, but Nicholas felt threatened and ordered his troops to fire on the protestors. The day has since been known as Bloody Sunday. For the next decade, resentment among the working classes festered.

Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Ottomans continually fought the Russians for control of the Balkans, the Black Sea, and surrounding areas. Most of the time, the Russians were victorious. So by the nineteenth century, not only was the Ottoman Empire considerably smaller and less powerful, but it was in danger of collapse. Greece, Egypt, and Arabia launched successful independence movements.

To ensure that Europe wouldn’t recolonize the Americas, U.S. President Monroe declared in his 1823 State of the Union Address that the western hemisphere was of-limits to European aggression. The United States, of course, wasn’t the superpower then that it is today, so it was hardly in a position to enforce its declaration, which became known as the Monroe Doctrine.

While Latin American nations have at times beneted from the protection and oversight of their North American neighbor, the Monroe Doctrine also gave rise to anger and resentment in many Latin Americans, who sometimes saw the United States as exercising its own brand of imperialism in the region.

The United States quickly and decisively destroyed the Spanish eets in Cuba and in the Philippines, and thereby gained control of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.

This facilitated the movement of resources and manufactured goods. The new industrial world required large numbers of laborers.

With industrialization came new imperialism and interactions. The arts and culture of Europe were inuenced by contact with Asia and Africa, and new more modern forms developed. Meanwhile, the Japanese started to integrate Western styles into traditional art forms.

Education, real wages, and professional opportunities continued to be mostly inaccessible; however, the new intellectual and economic opportunities available to men did open doors for women, and movements began throughout the world to rally for women’s political and legal rights. Although women continued to be heavily restricted with few freedoms, political and legal barriers for men based on class or racial categories were mostly eliminated.

Although most Western countries opened university education to women, literacy rates in China and India—countries with long histories of secluding women—remained shockingly low well into the twentieth century. However, male literacy in these regions was also low, and despite Christian missionary schools, it was not in the interest of the imperial powers to have a well-educated colonial populace. VII.

The rst round occurred after the Age of Exploration when the United States and Latin America declared their independence. The second round occurred after the Industrial Revolution and led to a race for new colonies in Asia and Africa. Those independence movements didn’t occur until after 1914, so they are not included this chapter.

The continuing impact of the Enlightenment. The end of slavery. Military superiority. Nationalism. Imperialism. Racism. Capitalism. Marxism. It’s mind- boggling. What’s more, these changes were communicated more quickly than ever before. Trains and ships raced across continents and seas. Telegraph cables were laid.

Urbanization, too, fueled change. As people came in closer contact with each other, ideas spread more quickly. Like-minded people were able to associate with each other. Individuals had contact with a greater variety of people, and therefore were exposed to a greater variety of ideas. Increasingly, developments in the cities raced along at a faster pace than those in villages and on farms. In India, for example, British imperialism greatly impacted life in the cities. Indians learned to speak English and adopted European habits. In the countryside, however, Hindu and Muslim culture continued along largely uninterrupted.

The United States declared its independence eloquently and convincingly, and then many of the signers went home to their slaves. Factory workers argued tirelessly for humane working conditions, but once achieved, happily processed raw materials stolen from distant lands where the interests of the natives were often entirely disregarded.

To be sure, European rivalries had had a global impact for centuries, particularly during the colonial period. The Seven Years’ War in the eighteenth century between the French and British, for example, impacted their colonial holdings everywhere. France, too, jumped in to help the U.S. in its revolution against the British. But in 1914, a major ght among European powers had a far more substantial and destructive eect.

Shifting Alliances: A Prewar Tally of European Countries In the decades leading up to World War I, the European powers tried to keep the balance of power in check by forming alliances. The newly unified Germany quickly gained industrial might, but it was worried that France, its archenemy since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, would seek revenge for its defeat. So, before he resigned from office, Otto von Bismarck created and negotiated the Triple Alliance among Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy in the 1880s.

By 1907, Britain had also signed friendly agreements with France and Russia, creating what became known as the Triple Entente.

The idealism of the provisional ocials caused them to badly miscalculate the depths of hostility the Russian people felt for the czar’s war.

The people didn’t share in the power or the prots, and had no choices regarding participation. Untold numbers died ghting to protect their farms. Even more died in famines that resulted when Stalin usurped crops to feed government workers at the expense of the farmers themselves. Stalin’s plans successfully industrialized the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), the formal name for the Soviet Union, and improved economic conditions for the country as a whole, but Stalin relied on terror tactics, such as a secret police force, bogus trials, and assassinations. These murders peaked between 1936 and 1938. Collectively, they are sometimes referred to as the “Great Purge”",

The Great Depression: Capitalism Crashes, Germany Burns World War I was shockingly expensive. Countries spent more than $180 billion on armaments, boats, and trench warfare. Europe spent an additional $150 billion rebuilding. The massive scale of the war meant massive spending, at a level that nations had never experienced previously, and in the years following World War I, capitalism nanced most of the recovery.

Germany experienced extreme nancial hardship because of the wartime reparations they were required to make under the Treaty of Versailles. Germany’s answer was to use American credit to pay its reparations by issuing I.O.U.s to countries like France. France took these “payments,” backed up by American credit, and spent them on rebuilding its economy.

Therefore, they’re not referred to as fascist, but they’re just as militaristic and controlling.

By 1921, the party seated its first members in the Italian parliament. Although the fascists held only a few seats in the legislature, Mussolini demanded that King Victor Emmanuel III name him and several other fascists to cabinet posts. To rally support, Mussolini organized his parliamentary thugs to march to Rome and possibly attempt to seize power.

More importantly, it was increasingly dicult for the subjugated peoples to tolerate their treatment, so they rose up and demanded independence. The Indian Subcontinent After the mostly Hindu Indian National Congress was established in 1885 to increase the rights of Indians under colonial rule, and then the Muslim League in 1906 to advance the causes of Islamic Indians, it took years for momentum to build into an organized resistance to colonial power.

While both groups worked together peacefully against the British, radical members of each group found it hard to tolerate the other.

It also provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi leader of an international terrorist network, known as Al Qaeda, which has a serious distaste for Saudi Arabia and the United States. It’s believed that Al Qaeda’s main issue with Saudi Arabia is that the ruling family is too cozy with the United States and that they have allowed U.S. troops to remain in the country since the Persian Gulf War, which amounts to the presence of indels in a kingdom that is home to Islam’s most holy sites. Al Qaeda despises the United States for what many believe are at least three reasons. First, the United States supports Israel, which the",

The towers of the World Trade Center fell to the ground, killing more than 2,500 civilians. The deaths of the people on all four planes and those killed at the Pentagon bring the total number of casualties to almost 3,000.

But why point out these Muslim countries? The so-called “McDonaldization” of the world can be used as both an example and a metaphor for the spread of what is predominantly a Western popular culture to the rest of the world. Many countries, such as India and even China, have embraced the fruits of Westernization, integrating and assimilating aspects of Western culture into their own.

Since loans from the IMF required economic reforms and austerity measures, major industries were privatized and others were publicly traded. India’s greatest advantage is its highly educated and skilled population, yet the focus on traditional industry advocated by Gandhi had left India isolated and unable to compete globally.

Environmental Change Until the 1980s, environmental issues focused on localized pollution or waste management, but along with global integration in every sector came global environmental concerns. Most recently, these concerns have focused on food, as suppliers become ever more distant from their consumers and trade agreements open up supply routes, but safety regulations may not follow. The “green revolution” of the 1950s and 1960s led to increased agricultural productivity through industrial means—chemical fertilizers and pesticides, biologically engineered foods, more ecient means of harvesting, and more marginal lands available for agriculture. While this resulted in inexpensive and plentiful food supplies, it destroyed traditional landscapes including rainforests in Indonesia and South America, reduced species diversity, and fostered social conicts that might not have otherwise existed. As has been true",

This is not a rapidly renewable resource and needs to be regulated for drinking and for agriculture. A similar pattern is seen with industrialized countries consumption of oil—they want more and they want it cheap! Oil fuels industry, transportation, and heating of homes and businesses. The insatiable appetite for oil reserves on the part of industrialized democracies can lead to strange political and economic alliances (see the previous section on the Middle East).

What the results of these warming trends will be is uncertain. On the positive side, there will be longer growing seasons in temperate parts of the world, but the negative will be more extreme conditions in marginal areas—longer periods of drought in some, ooding and disappearance of coastlines in others. The rst Earth Summit on global climate change was held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was an attempt to make a global agreement on ways to reduce environmental damages.

Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, new hardware and software was developed by American companies, who with the use of a silicon chip, had reduced the size and increased the power of the computer. By the late 1980s, the earliest versions of the World Wide Web were running out of northern Europe and by the early 1990s, commercial browsers allowed personal users to navigate e-mail, data, and news sources.

CHANGES AND CONTINUITIES IN THE ROLE OF WOMEN Finally, the upheavals and changes of the twentieth century resulted in really dramatic changes in women’s social, political, and economic roles.

Change came more slowly to the lower and working classes, but still it came.",

Politically, women gained the right to vote in many parts of the world by the rst quarter of the twentieth century. By 1930, that right had been gained by women in much of Latin America, Indian, China, and Japan and most of Europe. After World War II, most of the newly independent African countries included women’s surage in their constitutions, and it is only in the most fundamentalist of the Middle Eastern countries that women still do not have the right to vote. However, having the right to vote diers signicantly from having the education and opportunity to vote. In most Asian and African countries, female access to formal political power continues to be limited. Contradictions also exist between theory and practice in communist and formerly communist countries. Under communism, everyone was equal, women played key roles in the Communist Revolutions in Russia,",

Almost all key positions within the Communist parties were and are held by men. In China, the one-child policy and mandatory sterilization disproportionately impact women and female children. State-sponsored sterilization was also common in Puerto Rico and India. Additionally, the end of communism and the loosening of economic restrictions, seems to present more opportunities for men than for women. Family structure changed dramatically in the twentieth century, especially in the industrialized world. Birth rates dropped, birth control was widely available, and marriage rates declined as divorce and second marriages became more common. The twentieth century also saw dramatic changes in the role of women at work.",
    "752": "Beginning with wage labor in factories during the World Wars, women’s presence in the workforce has become more widely accepted. A shift to protable industries in chemicals, textiles and electronics, has provided further economic opportunities for women. By the mid-1980s, education and access in Westernized and industrialized countries allowed women to participate fully in the work force. But women in agricultural economies continued to have their labor under-enumerated and throughout the world, women’s pay has yet to fully equal that of her male counterparts, nor are women compensated for the time they spend on a “second shift” as primary caregivers of young children. V. PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER You’ve read about a lot of stu in this chapter. Two world wars. A cold war and all its consequences. The end of European imperialism. The rise of the United States as a superpower. Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East. These are all huge issues. And it’s hard to discern immediately how you",
    "753": "can connect them all together, other than to say that there were a lot of wars and a lot of hatred. Yet, beyond the morbidity and feelings of helplessness that a careful study of history can engender, there are also a lot of ways to think about history that can help you evaluate how people and the world function. In the last chapter, we talked a lot about nationalism, and it certainly didn’t stop in the twentieth century. Nationalism not only led to fascism in Nazi Germany, but also to independence movements after World War II in India and Africa, and in Europe and Asia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Sometimes it was based on broad cultural characteristics—Gandhi, for example, unsuccessfully wanting everyone to look at themselves as Indians, not as Hindus or Muslims—and other times it was very narrowly defined—Serbs, for example, or Nazis. Regardless of its forms, nationalism aected all of the major global events in the twentieth century. In both World War I and II, the aggressors",
    "754": "were highly nationalistic. The independence movements following World War II were nationalistic. And the Cold War, because it pitted two opposing worldviews that were so strongly identied with the nations of the Soviet Union and the United States, was arguably a nationalist struggle as well. National pride was on the line. And in the end, superpower status was on the line, too. By the late twentieth century, whether because of nationalism or not, there were a huge number of independent nation-states. Each former colony in Africa was independent. Lots of new countries formed from the old Soviet Union. What’s more, most of the countries were developing along democratic lines, though some along militaristic or Islamic theocratic lines, and capitalism seemed to be making huge gains after the fall of the Soviet Union, which leads us to the next question. IS THERE CURRENTLY A CONVERGENCE OF CULTURES? This is a tough question to answer. It could go either way, and if you study history enough,",
    "755": "you can argue for both sides. On the one hand, globalization is clearly occurring, and it’s been occurring for a long time. It’s just that now it’s getting a lot faster and it’s penetrating more and more hidden parts of the globe. Centuries ago, trade, conquest, and exploration were forms of globalization because they brought people together, essentially “making the world smaller.” Big movements like the Scientic Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution can certainly be categorized as movements toward globalization because they weren’t culturally specic, but rather could be applied nearly anywhere around the globe. They brought people closer together because they led to certain ways of thinking that were attractive and accepted by dierent kinds of people. If people start to agree on how the universe is organized or how governments should be organized, that is most certainly a convergence of cultures. In the twentieth century, globalization really got going. Aided by",
    "756": "transportation, communication, and imperialism, anything produced in one country could be received in another. Popular examples of globalization are the appearance of the same multinational companies everywhere (seeing a McDonalds in Istanbul) and certainly the use of the Internet, but globalization is much broader than even these examples. Globalization led to and continues to lead to an interconnectedness of entire economies. The Great Depression in the 1930s proved that the economies of most industrialized nations were heavily intertwined. Today, the economies are so intertwined that a fall in stock prices in Tokyo will have an instantaneous impact on the stock market in the United States. As more and more countries start to look the same (independent, democratic, constitutional), their economies function in similar ways (stock market, low barriers to trade, strong banking system), and their cultures look the same (educated people who know English, Hollywood movies playing at",
    "757": "theaters, cell phone in their hands), it can be strongly argued that there is a convergence of cultures. On the other hand, globalization doesn’t necessarily mean convergence. Globalization just means that everything is spread all around the globe all the time. It doesn’t mean that people accept, like, or want what’s being hurled at them. It just means that it’s available. Some argue that globalization will lead to an increase in the number of people who lash out against it, sometimes aggressively or violently. Globalization isn’t well received in Islamic fundamentalist countries, or in countries that are trying hard to maintain a historical cultural identity, like France. But more signicantly, it can’t be denied that the biggest movements of the twentieth century were rooted in self-determination and nationalism. The whole point of self-determination is for nations to chart their own course. If self-determination and nationalism mean that a country is going to use its independence to",
    "758": "do what every other country does, then why be independent in the rst place? Clearly, people want to chart their own course. They fought wars for the right to do so. They must have been doing so for a reason. So it makes sense that",
    "759": "want to chart their own course. They fought wars for the right to do so. They must have been doing so for a reason. So it makes sense that globalization will have its limits. And isn’t the world a whole lot less consolidated today than it was under European imperialism, when that small continent ruled the world? Doesn’t that suggest the opposite of global convergence? In the end, there’s no right answer to this question. The challenge is not to accurately predict the future, but to have an understanding of history to make a reasonable, defendable argument about the direction that history seems to be taking. If you can discuss globalization, nationalism, and self-determination in the same essay or conversation without totally losing your mind, you have command enough of the issues and complexities to be confident in yourself.
